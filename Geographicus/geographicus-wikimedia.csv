http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/HolyLand-tirinus-1632,Antique Map: 1632 Tirinus Map of the Holy Land - Israel w- numerous insets,"Chorographia Terrae Sanctae in Angustiorem Formam Redacta, et ex Variis Auctoribus a Multis Erroribus Expurgata","This is an extraordinary c. 1632 map of the Holy Land by the Jesuit monk Jacobus Tirinus.  Oriented to the east, map depicts from Syria and Tyre southward as far as the Sinai, Egypt and Thebes.  Ours survey of the map begins at the southern most point, in Egypt, where we find the city of Thebes and, slightly to the north, near Memphis, the wildly misshapen Pyramids of Egypt.   Slightly further north we see the city of Tanis, made famous in  Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark  as the resting place for the Ark of the Covenant.  In this spirit, slightly to the south of Tanis, the city of Ramesse is indicated as the starting point of the Biblical Exodus and the wandering of the Hebrews. We can follow their path into the desert and across the Red Sea – where Pharaoh is shown being inundated by the returning waters following Moses’ parting of the Red Sea.  Now in the Sinai, we can follow the footsteps of the Hebrews to Mount Sinai (Sinai Mons), where Moses is drawn throwing down the tablets of God.   Slightly to the northwest of this location a cleft in the mountains reveals the location of the ancient Nabatean city of Petra.  With regard to Petra, the location and gorge detail is surprisingly accurate considering that it was only “discovered” by the Swiss adventurer Johannes L. Burckhardt, in 1812, 200 years after this map was drawn.    Heading northward the lands claimed by the various tribes of Israel are beautifully detailed along with major cities, camps, roads, and trade routes. The Mediterranean is decorated with sailing ships and, in the lower left quadrant, a surveying tool between two censors.  Surrounding the map proper on the left, right, and bottom margins, there are 19 maps and images of Biblical objects.  The largest and most central of these is a stunning inset of Jerusalem, which notes the various temples and important buildings located there.  Other images include the Arc of the Covenant, Israelite coins, Roman antiquities, views of a Menorah, various angels, and a plan of the Temple.   All in all an extraordinary piece, one of the most attractive maps of the Holy Land ever made.  Originally prepared in 1632 for Jacobus Tirinus’s study of the Holy Land Commentarius Vestus et Novum Testamentum Tomis Tribus Comprehensus  (Commentary on the New and Old Testament).  It was most likely engraved by Cornelius Galle and printed in Antwerp by Martinus Nutius. This work went through several printings in the subsequent 20 years that followed its original issue, so determining the exact  issue is, for the most part, impossible.  However, we can assume that this map was printed between 1632 and 1650.",c. 1632 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/tirinus.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/HolyLand-tirinus-1632.jpg,HolyLand-tirinus-1632,32.5,12.5

Printed in 1788 for inclusion in Schraembal’s  Allgemeiner Grosser Atlas , this is one of the first maps issued to depict North America following the American Revolutionary War.  While this map has been updated to reflect the surveys prepared under Massachusetts governor Thomas Pownall, it is heavily  based upon the important 1783 map of North America issued by Sayer and Bennet.  The whole is beautifully rendered with wonderful detail regarding the early states, roads, canals, the Great Lakes, American Indian Nations, and explorer’s observations.  Vermont is not present on the map.  Most of the southern states are without western boundaries, but seem to extend only to the Appellation Mountain range. In the upper left quadrant there is an inset of the Baffin and Hudson Bay region including some references to the explorations of Admiral De Fonte in search of a Northwest Passage, as well as to the indigenous Eskimo tribes.

Chart contains a wealth of practical information for the mariner from oceanic depths, to harbors and navigation tips on navigating the tidal currents.  This map was created under the direction of A. D. Bache, Superintendent of the Survey of the Coast of the United States and one of the most influential American cartographers of the 19th century.  The hydrography for this map was accomplished by a party under the command of Cha. H. Davis in 1846-48 and Cha. H. Mc. Blair in 1849-51.  Bache himself discussed the difficult of accurately mapping the regions south and west of Nantucket in his 1852 Congressional Report:    The most difficult piece of hydrography on our coast has been completed during the past season. The area of broken ground east and south of the island of Nantucket is nearly seven hundred miles in extent, and is spread with dangers, some real and some only apparent. The work which has been prosecuted there perseveringly for some seasons has made the position of the dangers fully known, and has in turn employed the resources and taxed the perseverance of some of the most able hydrographers of the survey. It was commenced in 1846 by Lieut. C. H. Davis, U.S.N., has been continued since 1849 by Lieut. C. H. McBlair, and has this year been completed by Lieut. H. S. Stellwagen. The breaking of the water over these sunken shoals and banks ... which, under the name of Rips, occurs extensively over this region, serves, no doubt, to increase the terrors of the spot, though indicating in reality a change of depth, and not absolute shoalness. The outliers of this ground, Fishing Rip and Davis's Bank, have twenty-five and a half feet upon them, while on Great Rip, the Rose and Crown, Old South, and Davis's shoal, there are, respectively, but four, seven, six, and eight feet. The arrangement of these shoals led us to suppose that there must be dangers south of Davis's shoal, and several attempts have been made to look them up. The explorations of Lieutenant Commanding Stellwagen this year have completed the search over the space south of Davis's shoal to deep water, without any indication of another tier of banks. The hydrography of such ground as this is truly difficult; it must be surveyed with the minuteness of a harbor, without the facilities which neighboring land affords. The land cannot be seen from the deck of a vessel from Davis's shoal, and yet it must be traversed closely with the sounding line, and the position of the soundings be closely determined. It is necessary to establish bases from those on land by floating objects, which, like vessels, can be seen at a sufficient distance, and to preserve temporarily the positions of these floating stations by buoys. The first severe storm not only stops the actual sounding work, but is apt to break up the system entirely by removing or changing the position of these marks. The weather fit for surveying on that peculiarly stormy part of the coast is but a small fragment of each summer, and the harbors which must necessarily be sought as a refuge on the coming up of storms, which cannot be weathered in such exposed situations, are distant. It is no small source of congratulation that this difficult work is well through with, and without accident to those who have so faithfully encountered the very dangers which they seek in order to instruct others how to avoid them....",1851 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/uscs.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Nantucket-uscs-1852.jpg,Nantucket-uscs-1852,19.5,18

This is most likely the first world map to depict the oceans currents.  Shows the entire world in accordance with Kircher’s hydro-geographic theory that tides and currents are caused by water moving to and from a massive subterranean ocean.  Kircher postulated that water entered and exited the subterranean ocean via a number of great abysses situated around the globe.   This map expounds on Kircher’s theories by noting the abysses and the currents they create as well as the locations of the world’s known volcanoes.    Between the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Persian Gulf, Kircher theorized massive tunnels and a complex interchange of water flows.  These tunnels are noted most particularly between the Black and Caspian Sea and between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf.   Antarctica is shown along the southern part of the map.  In the North a great open northwest passage is depicted running all the way across the map.  Shows New Guinea and a suggestion of Australia attached to the “Australsis Incognita” mainland.  Africa is shown with considerably greater accuracy than many maps drawn hundreds of years later – particularly with regard to Niger and Nile River Systems.  North America and South America are both wildly malformed, indicating a relatively sketchy knowledge of the continent.

Represents the 1867 state of the map in which the western states appear much as they do today with but two notable exceptions.  Wyoming retains its western panhandle, which was later resolved into Montana, and Dacotah (Dacota) is one large state.

The Northeast Passage, much like American’s Northwest Passage, was a long sought after sea route through the Arctic that would save European merchantman the expense of rounding Africa in order to access the trade riches of East Asia.  This map deals primarily with Asiatic Russia, detailing the Northeast Passage from Norway and Iceland westward as far as Alaska (Anian), Kamschatka, Yesso, and Japan.   Knowledge of this area was, at the time, speculative at best and this is reflected in the map.  Shows many unknown islands, misshapen representations of Kamtschaka, Japan, Hokkaido (Yesso), and Alaska.   Notes Peking (Beijing), Nanking (Nanjing), Corea (Korea),  Jedo (Tokyo)and Nangasaki (Nagasaki).     The four inset maps of America depicted in the lower left-hand quadrant are of special interest.  All four loosely reference Wytfliet’s  seminal  1597  American Atlas .   The upper left inset (I), depicts the northwest coast of America from the Bay of California to a conjectural Alaska, a misshapen Japan and a mysterious I. de Plata.  Depicts the mythical city of Quivira on the Alaskan coast.  This map was based upon the California sheet of Wytfliet’s Atlas.  Inset (II), also drawn from the Wytfliet California, shows the Bay of California and Nova Granada.  Plate (III) depicts the Conibas-Zubgara region. This region, which appeared first in Mercator’s 1569 atlas has been loosely interoperated, depending  upon the source, as the Northwest Passage, the Hudson Bay, or the first map of the Great Lakes.  Plate IV shows what is almost certainly Alaska, labeled  Anian Regnum .  Here is a real cartographic curiosity, where myth become fact, which again becomes myth.  Anian is a term derived from a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.” However, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of poetry to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name.

Bormeester.,"An extremely scarce 1684 double hemisphere world by Dutch map publisher Joachim Bormeester.  Depicts the world on hemisphere projection with polar projections to the top and bottom of the main map.  Surrounded by allegorical images and border decorations with a classical theme.  Heavily based upon, but much rarer than, the Visscher world map of 1658, with similar cartography and Nicholas Berchem’s border designs.  We begin our survey of this map in North America. California is depicted as an island.  The American northwest is largely blank and unexplored though the land of Anian does appear in the extreme northwest.  Anian, first mentioned in the journals of Marco Polo, is the semi-mythical land one arrives at having transited the Northwest Passage.  Heading east, the Great Lakes are shown as a single massive inland lake with no western boundary.    Southward finds us in South America where both the Amazon and the Rio de la Plata meet in a great lake. Another mysterious and vast inland lake appears in what is roughly modern day Guiana and Venezuela.  The Pacific offers a few interesting destination. New Zealand appears only as a line of coast with no northern southern or eastern borders.  Several islands dot the South Pacific, but any connection with true geography here seems entirely conjectural.   In the Eastern Hemisphere, Africa is displayed according to the 17th century conceptions of the interior.  The source of the Nile depicted here conforms to the Ptolemaic double lake theory prevalent at the time.  The Niger River system passes through several enormous lakes which are entirely conjectural.  Other interior detail in the African continent is extensive but wholly inaccurate.  In Asia the Great Wall of China is displayed. Korea is shown as an island. Kamtschaka is not present though Siberia does extend eastward slightly into the Western Hemisphere.  Further south, Australia is recognizable if only sketchily mapped.  Antarctica remains undiscovered.   In the northern polar projection no suggestion is made of Northwest Passage.  Surrounded by elaborate classical motif border images originally drawn by Berchem for Visscher’s map.   These include the Rape of Persephone, Zeus in his chariot, Demeter offering the gifts of the Earth, and Poseidon riding his chariot out of the sea.  An extremely scarce find.

Holland. - A Chorographical Map of the Country between Albany, Oswego, Fort Frontenac, and Les Trois Rivieres; Exhibing all the Grands made by the French Governors  on Lake Champlain; & between that Lake & Montreal.","A first issue first edition example of a seminal map.  This is a rare and unusual version of the 1768 first edition of Holland and Jefferys seminal map of New York and New Jersey.   Depicts the important trade corridor between New York and Montreal, specifically detailing from Delaware Bay northward including parts of eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Long Island, New York Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont as well as the Iroquois League, the Trois Rivieres territories and Montreal, as far as Lac St. Pierre in modern day Quebec.  Lower right quadrant features a pictorial title cartouche showing the Hudson River.  This extraordinary map is unusual on many levels in addition to its status as the first edition first state of an extremely rare and important map.   Unlike most examples, this map is in an independent issue and has no suggestion that it may have been bound into an atlas.  Instead it is linen backed in wall map format.  Secondly, though most examples of this map, even other first editions, show the New York-New Jersey border much where it is today, our example was colorized to show the line running considerably south of its currently location – a rarity which can be seen in only three other known examples.  While we would not describe this as a different state, as the essential engraving is the same as was used in other 1868 editions, the difference in coloration is fascinating, unusual, and bears attention.  This requires a bit of explanation:   Much of the cartography for this map was derived from the work of surveyor Samuel Holland produced in his roles as New York – New Jersey boundary commissioner and later as “Surveyor of the Northern District” for the Board of Trade which governed the crown colonies in America.  As this map was being prepared a fierce legal battle raged between the colonies of New York and New Jersey regarding the position of their western border.    The dispute between the New York and New Jersey regarding their western border was long standing and complex. New Jersey contended that its northern border accorded with the findings of a survey issued in 1719, which extended the border northward as far as Station Point, well north of the current line.  New York, on the other hand, contended for a southerly border based upon surveys performed in 1686.  The Board of Trade commissioned Samuel Holland to create a map of this disputed region.   Holland’s work resulted in a manuscript map , now lost, that was submitted to the Board of Trade in England.  Holland, who favored New York, argued that the original crown charter defining the New York and New Jersey border was based upon intersecting lines referencing a branching of the Delaware River and the old divide between East and West Jersey.   This would put much of what is today northern New Jersey firmly in New York.    The dispute was finally settled in 1768 by agreement to a compromised line roughly where it stands today – note 1768 is the same year that Jefferys engraved this map.   In his role as Geographer to the King, Jefferys would have had access to the Holland maps which were prepared for the Board of Trade and sent to London.  It is likely that Jefferys used these materials, along with the works of Evans and Colden to compile this much grander map.   As the official Royal Geographer, Jefferys would not have been required to ask permission to use any of these materials and indeed, as Powell suggests, it is likely that the “Name of Capt. Holland is put, without his Knowledge or Consent”.  Most likely, Jefferys ordered the peculiar coloration of this map, which follows the southern border NY-NJ border following recommendations in Holland’s notes.  Holland advocated for the southerly border that we see colorized here.   Probably this is a preliminary state of the map, printed sometime early in 1768, before the compromise boundary was formalized.",1768 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/holland.txt,"Seems to be an independent issue, though a similar example appears in Thomas Jeffery's <i>General Topography of North America and the West Indies</i>, 1768.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NewYorkNewJersey-sayer-1768.jpg,NewYorkNewJersey-sayer-1768,21,53

Covers the entire continent of Asia as well as parts of Europe and northeastern Africa.   This is essentially a revised and updated version of J. B. Homann’s 1712 map of Asia.  Features some interesting and important updates.  Most notably, we see the addition of the Kamchatka Peninsula in the upper right hand quadrant.  The lower part of the peninsula is labeled “Kurilorum Regio”, no doubt an early reference to the Kuril Islands.  While Hokkaido is not present, Japan itself is separated from the mainland by a small archipelago. Just east of these islands we see the Canal de Piecko, and beyond that a large and curious land mass labeled Compagnie Land.  Compagnie Land is a mythical landmass that can be traced the work of an unknown Spanish pilot who supposedly traveled from China to New Span and published his finding along with the works of Thevenot.  Present in both the 1712 map and this one, Compagnie’s Land could possibly be an early representation of Alaska or a misrepresentation of Hokkaido.  Korea or Corea is present if misshapen in roughly the correct location.

Johnson's Chart of Comparative Heights of Mountains, and Lengths of Rivers of South America.  Johnson's Chart of Comparative Heights of Mountains, and Lengths of Rivers of North America.","This is the 1864 edition of Johnson's Mountains and Rivers Chart.   This chart, printed in 1864, represents a significant reimagining and re-engraving of Johnson's pre-1864 mountains and rivers charts.  Johnson first introduced a mountains and rivers chart in the second edition of his atlas, published in 1861.  That chart, based on a related 1855 chart engraved by J. H. Colton, was very similar to other topical charts common in European atlases of the period in that it presented all of the great mountains and rivers of the world in a single panoramic view.  Johnson, perhaps recognizing that the traditional chart, which necessarily highlighted the primacy of the great mountains and rivers of Asia, was difficult to read with regard to the regions that interested his constituent readers - North Americans and Europeans.  Thus Johnson re-engraved his chart, taking the bold step of dividing the world's great mountains and rivers by continent.   This curious move made the map more accessible on a continental level.  Johnson's 1864 mountains and rivers chart can also be read from a political perspective, for by dividing the mountains according to continents, each continent's mountains appear equally great.  While Johnson is not the first to focus his mountains and rivers chart on particular continent, this is the first example we are aware of that consolidate the mountains  and rivers all of the continents, each represented individually, on a single chart.  The chart is ordered roughly alphabetically in five sections, with Africa at the top, followed by Asia, Europe, South America and North America.   Curiously Johnson chooses to place North America below South America - a clear break his is alphabetical sequence. This unusual move is possibly in deference to the perceived greater importance of North America relative to its southerly cousin.   In the Africa section, Kilimanjaro is identified as  the highest mountain, and the Nile its longest river.  This chart also includes the Great Pyramid.   In the Asia second, Everest, at 29,000 feet is recognized as the highest mountain  and the Yangtze as the longest river. In the Europe section, the highest mountain is Mont Blanc and the Volga is recognized as the longest River.  IN South America, Tupungato (Tupungata), at 22, 450 feet is identified as the highest mountain (Aconcagua is a sad no. 2) and the Amazon is the greatest River.  North America, still not fully explored when this map was published lists Mt. St. Elias, of the Canadian Yukon, as the highest mountain, followed by the Popocatepetl and Orizaba volcanoes of Mexico.  This is in fact somewhat reversed from actuality, with Orizaba  being the highest at 18,504 feet, followed by Elias at 18,009 feet, and Popocatepetl at 17,930. At this time, neither Mount McKinley (Denali) nor Mount Logan, the true highest peaks of North America, had been measured.  Even so, Johnson does correctly recognized the Mississippi as the continent's  longest river.   Published by A. J.

Based upon an earlier map of the region by Thomas Engel, this is a fascinating examination of the general layout and waterways of North America – especially in the west.    Curiously does not specifically show a Northwest Passage, but leaves clear the possibility that one such passage may indeed exist.  Rivers and lakes extending from the eastern part of the continent almost, but never quite meet their counterparts from the west.  While the east is displayed with reasonable accuracy, the cartography of the western part of North America is almost entirely conjectural and based upon early reports from Jesuit missionaries.   Six largely mythical river systems extend inland from the Pacific or, as it appears on this map, “Mer du Sud”.   Several meet with enormous and interesting mythical lakes.  The northern most of these is Lake Conibas, the center of a supposed lake region that first appeared in Mercator’s 1569 map of America.  Mercator’s version of Conibas been loosely interpreted, depending  upon the source, as the Northwest Passage, the Hudson Bay, or the first map of the Great Lakes.   Vaugondy situates this region is further west, making it the source of several river systems and a potential station in a “northwest passage”.  Another lake, further south is labeled the “L. des Tahuglauks”.  This lake, which is shown as the source of the mythical “River of the West”, was first reported by the French traveler Baron de Lahonton, who claimed to have traveled in this area in 1702.   After traveling westward along what he called the “R. Longue”, which is shown, he claims to have arrived at the city of Moseemlek.  There the local tribal peoples reported the existence of a large salt water lake to the west, possibly an early report of Great Salt Lake.  Back in France, De L’Isle added the lake to his map of North America and, later, Vaugondy included it on this map.   There are also a number of interesting political features.   The region that roughly corresponds to modern Alaska is labeled  Anian Regnum .  Here is a real cartographic curiosity, where myth become fact, which again becomes myth.  Anian is a term derived from the journals of Marco Polo and its first cartographic appearance is in a 1561 map by the Venetian cartographer Bolognini Zaltieri. Later it was popularized in a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.” However, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of poetry into cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name.  Further south we find “Grand Quivira” referencing one of the many mythical Kingdoms of Gold.  Much of the west is labeled “Allies des Sioux”, an idea mostly probably derived from Jesuit missionary reports.  Greenland is shown attached to the mainland.  All in all, an extremely attractive and important late 18th century mapping of North America.  This map is part of the 10 map series prepared by Vaugondy for the Supplement to Diderot’s  Encyclopédie , of which this is plate 1.

Essentially depicts the north eastern parts of Asia, speculations on northwestern America and Admiral De Fonte’s mythical conception of a Northwest Passage.   Heavily based upon earlier work by Thomas Jefferys, Thomas Swaine Drage, Gerhard Muller, and James De Lisle.   Vaugondy prepared this map prior to the voyages of James Cook to this region.   Around this time Europe was rampant with speculation both regarding the existence of a Northwest Passage and the northwestern parts of America in general.   The discoveries of Admiral de Fonte and Juan de Fuca though now known to be entirely mythical, inspired the European imagination.    Barthlomew de Fonte was supposedly a Spanish Admiral who, sailing up the Pacific coast c. 1640 discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward towards the Hudson Bay.  Supposedly, upon one of these great inland lakes, he met with a ship from Boston that claimed to have come through a Northwestern Passage.  De Fonte’s story appeared in a short lived 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”.  The story inspired no less than Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle, younger brother of the better known Guilleme de L’Isle.  Joseph-Nicholas, at the time, was employed by the Russian Tzar Peter the Great in the compilation of Russian surveys and discoveries in Siberia and the extreme northeast of Asia.  When he published his somewhat accurate map of northeast Asia, he paradoxically decided to include with it an entirely speculative map of North America based largely on De Fonte’s letter.  De L’Isle’s mantle was later taken up by Jefferys, another ardent supporter of the Northwest Passage theory, in his own map of the region, which was, ultimately, the inspiration for this map by Vaugondy.  In accord with De Fonte’s suggestions  this map displays the strait of Juan de Fuca continuing inland  past the large lakes of Velasco, Belle and De Fonte to communicate with the Baffin and Hudson Bay.  There are also a series of rivers and waterways connecting the lakes themselves to an outlet in the Arctic.  Based upon Russian reports, Vaugondy rename the “Straits of Ainan”, the “Detroit de Bering”, paying homage to the great Russian navigator.  Anian itself has been moved southward nearer to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Anian is a term derived from the journals of Marco Polo and first appeared in 1561 on a map by teh Venetian cartographer Bolognini Zaltieri.  Later it appeared in a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.” However, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of poetry to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name. Further south still we find Quivira, one of the legendary northern American Kingdoms of Gold.  Nearer to Russia the Aleutian Islands have been consolidated into a large peninsular landmass extending eastward towards Asia.  In the extreme north, between 80 and 60 degrees of latitude is an archipelago, presumably discovered by the Japanese, and purportedly inhabited entirely by pigmies.  This entire  map is in sharp contrast to De L’Isle map of the same region.  In an alternative to the Jefferys map, De L’Isle imagined a slightly more distorted picture of the extreme northeast divided into a number of great islands with gigantic Bays and inland seas heading eastward towards Hudson Bay.  These two disparate cartographic interpretations of the De Fonte story inspired considerable debate among European intellectual circles until the matter was finally put to rest by the expeditions of James Cook.  Nonetheless, this is altogether fascinating map of the Northwest Passage and the American west and a must for any serious collection dedicated to this region.",1772 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/vaugondy.txt,"Supplement to Diderot's <i>Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers.</i> or Vaugondy's <i>Recueil de 10 Cartes Traitant Particulierement de L'Amerique du Nord</i>, (1779).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/DeFonte-vaugondy-1768.jpg,DeFonte-vaugondy-1768,14.5,12.5

This map, prepared by Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle 1762 and republished by Vaugondy in 1772, covers parts of Siberia and northeastern Asia as well as the northwestern parts of the American continent, including the Hudson Bay, and the legendary Northwest Passage.  Traces the routes of several important explorers, most notably Tchirikow, Frondat, Bering and De Fonte.  The origins of the wonderful map can be traced to a 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”.  This short-lived magazine published a previously unpublished account by a Spanish Admiral named Bartholomew de Fonte.   De Fonte is said to have sailed up the Pacific coast of North America in 1640.   On this voyage he apparently discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward from the Pacific towards Hudson Bay. The De Fonte story relates how, on one of these great inland lakes, he met with a westward bound ship from Boston that must to have come through the Northwest Passage.  Today, based upon inaccuracies and falsities, we know the entire De Fonte article to have been a fabrication, however, it set 18th century afire with speculation that a Northwest Passage must indeed exist.   When Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle, younger brother of the better known Guilleme de L’Isle, returned from his tenure at Russian Tzar Peter the Great’s “Academy of Sciences” he decided to publish a compilation of secret cartographic data obtained from previously unknown Russian expeditions to Kamtschaka and the coast of Siberia. These seminal explorations included the discoveries of Tchirikow, Frondat, Bering, among others.    He produced a ground breaking and largely accurate mapping of the peninsula of Kamchatka and the coast of northeast Asia.  However, across the Pacific, the contrast with reality could not be more extreme.  De L’Isle based the fantastical North American portion of this map entirely on the supposed journeys of De Fonte.  This map traces the course of De Fonte from Cape Medocino northward, past the mouth of the mythical “Mer De L’Ouest” discovered by Juan de Fuca in 1692, around an unknown archipelago to access a series of lakes and rivers heading eastward to communicate with the Hudson Bay.  It was on one of these great lakes, possibly the Lac Belle or the large Lac de Fonte, where De Fonte claims to have encountered a westward bound vessel heading from Boston.  Heading north form this same archipelago, De L’Isle also describes De Fonte’s Lac Valasco and Lake Bernarda, which run eastward towards Baffin Bay only to be blocked at their extreme eastern terminus.  Dominating the northern part of the map is a great Arctic continent which blocks any further potential for a northwest passage to the north.  The upper left quadrant of this map features an alternative take on De Fonte’s Strait of Anian.  Anian was first mentioned in the journals of Marco Polo and was first noted on maps by Bolognini Zaltieri in 1561.  Later the term  was popularized in a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.”    In the 18th century, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of fiction to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name.  This entire  map is in sharp contrast to Jefferys’ map of the same region.  In an alternative to the De L’Isle map, Jefferys imagined a slightly more accurate picture of the extreme northeast with a series of large rivers running eastward towards Hudson Bay.  These two disparate cartographic interpretations of the De Fonte story inspired considerable debate among European intellectual circles until the matter was finally put to rest by the expeditions of James Cook.",1772 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/vaugondy.txt,"Supplement to Diderot's <i>Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers.</i> or Vaugondy's <i>Recueil de 10 Cartes Traitant Particulierement de L'Amerique du Nord</i>, (1779).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/DeFonteAutres-vaugondy-1772.jpg,DeFonteAutres-vaugondy-1772,15,11.5

Bauche Pr. Geograp? Du Roi presentee a l'Adad? Des Sciences le g Aout 1762 et approuvee dans son assemblee du 6 Septembre suivant.   -  Extrait d'une Carte Japonoise de L'Univers apportee en Europe par Kaempser et deposee dans le cabinet de seu Mr. Han-Sloane president de la Soceity Royale de Londres.,"This is a fascinating combination of two contrasting maps on a single sheet.   Both maps cover the northeastern parts of Asia and the northwestern parts of North America.  This two map chart was originally drawn by Phillip Buache to expound upon his theories regarding the northwest coast of America and more specifically upon the possibility of a Northwest Passage.      The upper map, entitled “Carte des Nouvelles Decouvertes” is a combination of data absconded from the Russian “Academy of Sciences” and Buache’s speculations on the Northwest Passage.  When Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle, younger brother of the better known Guilleme de L’Isle, returned from his tenure at Russian Tzar Peter the Great’s “Academy of Sciences” he decided to publish a compilation of secret cartographic data obtained from previously unknown Russian expeditions to Kamtschaka and the coast of Siberia. These seminal explorations included the discoveries of Tchirikow, Frondat, Bering, among others.    De L’Isle produced a ground breaking and largely accurate mapping of the peninsula of Kamchatka and the coast of northeast Asia  - shown here.    De L’Isle contracted Buache, already a prominent cartographic figure due to his introduction of hachures as a method for displaying elevation on a two dimensional plane, to  complete the North American part of the map.  Buache used the mythical voyages of Admiral de Fonte and Juan de Fuca as his cartographic source material.    The two sides of this map therefore could not be more heavily contrasted, for the mapping of Asia is largely accurate where the mapping of North America is almost entirely fantastical.  This map shows  the “Sea of the West”, supposedly discovered by Fuca, as well as the series of lakes, rivers, and canals heading eastward toward the Baffin and Hudson Bays that were purportedly first identified by De Fonte.  These include Lac de Fonte, Lac Belle and Lac de Valasco.  The Aleutian Islands are drawn, based upon various recorded land sightings by Russian explorers in the early 18th century, as a single peninsular land mass.  This map also traces the voyages of Kamtchatka, St. Antoine and unnamed Russian explorers.  Buache and De L’Isle presented this map to the French Academy of Sciences in 1762.  The lower map is a supposed recreation of an early Japanese Map discovered by Englebert Kaempfer and presented to Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society of London.  Kaempher was a German traveler who spent two years in Japan attached to the Dutch Embassy.  When he returned to Europe he carried with him numerous documents including an earlier state of the bottom map on this sheet.  Displays Asia crudely with only Japan, many times its actual size, displayed with any relative accuracy.  This map does however include the Great Wall of China and Baja California – drawn with the hint of a Northwest Passage.  To the left of the lower map is an extract from the Journals of Kaempfer describing Japan and its knowledge of America.  To the right side of the lower map is an advertisement claiming the source of this map to be a wall map in the Emperor’s palace in Japan.  This map is part of the 10 map series prepared by Vaugondy for the Supplement to Diderot’s  Encyclopédie , of which this is plate 6.

Includes two contrasting maps, both drawn from larger 17th century maps by Visscher, covering  from Cabo san Lucas northward along Baja California to modern day Alaska and the Arctic.  The larger map lists many place names, both factual and fictional, along the California coast.  These include the Bay of San Miguel (San Diego), Bay de Feugos, C. Mendocino, Costa Brava, and others.  Inland details include a number of river systems extending northwards from the Bay of California, the Sierra Nevada  Mountains, and the Kingdoms of Tontoneteac Regnum, Tolm Regnum, Albion, Quivira Regnum and Anian Regnum.    Many of these lands are mythical.  Anian, for example, near modern day Alaska, was first mentioned in the journals of Marco Polo and was first noted on maps by the Venetian Cartographer Bolognini Zaltieri in 1561.  Later the term  was popularized in a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.”    In the 18th century, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of fiction to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name.  Just south of Anian Regum is the kingdom of Quivira.  Quivira was supposedly an ancient city of gold located somewhere in North America.  The conquistador Coronado spent years searching for it only, some say, to arrive and find it to be little more than an American Indian wigwam town.   The smaller of the two maps,  derived from the Visscher and Pierre Plantius’s map of 1641, bears a considerably  greater resemblance to actuality. Includes many actual destinations along the coast including the Cape of San Francisco.  An entrance through the “Estreto de Anian” seems to lead to an Arctic Sea, thus suggesting a Northwest Passage.  This map also labels both Anian and Quivira, even going so far as to note the city of Quivira, capital of the great mythical kingdom.  This map is part of the 10 map series prepared by Vaugondy for the Supplement to Diderot’s  Encyclopédie , of which this is plate 4.

The map is based upon the remarkable work of Guillaume de L’Isle.  Depicts the entire world on a hemisphere projection with two smaller hemispheres describing the Polar  Regions.  In accordance with de L’Isle’s rather high minded perspective on speculative cartography this map shows considerable restraint with regard to unknown and unexplored regions - particularly the northwestern parts of America, the northeastern parts of Asia, and the Australian continent.  Unexplored areas are largely left blank.  A few interesting anomalies did, however, work their way into this map.  The most interesting of these is the depiction of “Frislandia” between Iceland and Greenland.   Frislandia, not to be confused with Frisland, on the European mainland, is a “Ghost Island” that supposed appeared and disappeared on the horizon.  Most maps issued by 1750 or so abandoned this notion, but as the legend and indeed this map attest, the island does have a habit of reappearing!  On the opposite side of the world Japan is shown as a peninsula attached to the Asian Mainland of Yedso.  Further east the mythical land of Terre de la Compagnie is also noted.   To the south, Van Diemen’s Land or Tasmania make a cursory appearance as does Antarctica, labeled “Cap. Terrae Australes”.  Australia is shows attached to New Guinea.  New Zealand is not present.

Picking up where his predecessor Gunnison, who died while doing his own survey’s of this region, left off, Beckwith surveyed passages along the both Weber and Timpanagos canyons.  He ultimately proposed three possible railroad routes.  The northernmost route crosses the Green River near Black's Fork and continues past Fort Bridger (now Wyoming) and along the Weber River to Ogden City where it turns south. The middle route leaves the Wasatch Mountains via Timpanogas Canyon.  The southernmost route runs westward from the Oquirrh Mountains. The northernmost route, which was advocated by Beckwith in his report, was chosen and it is roughly along this path that the transcontinental railroad was eventually built.

Lists the Apache Indians and the “Supposed Strait of Annian”.   Anian is a term derived from a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.” However, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of poetry to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name.

Covers all five Great Lakes and extends westward as far as the Mississippi River valley.  This map is a careful study of the Great Lakes Region and reveals Coronelli’s fascination with this area.  Coronelli derived his cartographic information from the reports of Jesuit Missionaries who were actively proselytizing in this region throughout the mid to late 18th century. These included the explorations of La Salle, Hennepin, Marquette and Jolliet, among others.  Dotted with forts, Indian villages, and missionary stations.  Shows the R.

This wonderful map was produced during a period of rapid westward expansion toward the Mississippi River and attempts address a general fascination with this largely unexplored territory.   One of this map’s most compelling features is the massive “Western Territory” encompassing all of modern day Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and parts of Minnesota.  Offers copious notations and comments throughout, most of which are extremely interesting.  A note in Kentucky, for example, referencing the frontiersman Daniel Boon, reads “Kentucky, this Colony was first discovered by J. Macbride &amp; others in the Year 1754.  Col. D.

Florida is divided at the Appalachicola River into eastern and western sections.  West Florida, ostensibly part of the Louisiana Purchase, was claimed by the Spanish and remained under their control until 1812.   Southern Florida is labeled “Ancient Tegesta” according to the 18th century convention.  Tegesta is a name of somewhat mysterious origins that appears on maps of Florida as early as the 1600s.

Depicts the entire continent as well as parts of Europe, Africa, and the East Indies.  In drawing this map Rossi drew heavily upon Nicholas Sanson’s map of Asia in ancient times.  In East Asia the cartography is still fairly speculative.  Hokkaido is shown attached to the mainland in a vast peninsula named  Yvpi .  Separated from this landmass by the narrow Strait of  St. Vries  is a mysterious landmass called  Ieco , a name which itself is commonly associated with Hokkaido. West of Japan, Korea appears as a narrow peninsula after the Mercator-Honduis example.  Further inland, in western China, Chiamay Lake is depicted.  This mythical body of water was postulated by Ortelius as source for the great rivers of Southeast Asia.  In a marked departure from Sanson’s map, Rossi corrects the orientation of the Caspian Sea to the proper north-south axis.  In the East Indies he separates New Guinea into separate islands, “Terra de Papous” and “N. Guinea”.  In the far north the Mongol empire is labeled Magog, referencing Marco Polo’s association of Mongolia with the Biblical land of “Magog.”  An attractive decorative title cartouche referencing the military prowess of the Saracens and the Mongols adorns the upper left quadrant.

Covers from Europe and Africa eastward  to include all of Asia, the East Indies, Japan, and parts of New Guinea and Australia.   From west to east, this map offers numerous elements worthy of further study.  The Caspian Sea, according to the convention of the time, is presented on an east-west rather than north-south axis.  Arabia is projected in a distended form. Further east in western China,  Cayamay lacus  is depicted.  This mythical body of water was postulated by Ortelius to be the source great rivers of Southeast Asia.  Indeed, Ortelius crisscrosses East Asia with a vast network of waterways advocating his belief that a water route existed through China to the North Sea and hence, via the Northeast Passage, to Europe.  Still further east Japan appears in a distorted top heavy projection that resembles a tadpole.  To the south Luzon is absent from the Philippine Islands. In the extreme southeast portion of the map Australia appears as “Terrae Incognitae Australis”.  East of China, two sailing ships ply the waters of the Pacific. A large decorative title cartouche adorns the lower left hand quadrant.   Ortelius based this map on his own wall map of 1567.  This map was issued as page 3 in the 1872-73 German language edition of Ortelius’s  Theatrum Orbis Terrarum  and corresponds to Van den Broecke’s Ort 6 classification, predating the more common Ort 7 map of Asia that appeared in 1574.",1572 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/ortelius.txt,"Ortelius, A., <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</i>, (1572 German language edition)",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/AsiaeNovaDescriptio-ortelius-1570.jpg,AsiaeNovaDescriptio-ortelius-1570,20,15

Renders the full sprawling extant of the Russian Empire from the Black Sea to the northwestern parts of the American Continent (Alaska) in extraordinary detail. The inland detail throughout is superb, noting cities, villages and forts as well as political distinctions, mountains, rivers and seas.  Displays the river systems of Siberia and central Russia with surprising accuracy and detail. Far to the east, this map exhibits a fairly accurate rendering of Kamtschatka, Alaska and the Aleutian islands, suggesting that the cartographer had access to both the cartographic data gathered by Cook and the work of Behring and other Russian explores. Sakhalin is rendered as two separate islands, though, save for that fact, fairly accurately.  The rendering of Hokkaido, though incomplete, is also somewhat accurate.  There are extensive explorer’s annotations along the Arctic shores of Russia.  A large decorative title cartouche at the top center, roughly at the North Pole, depicts a torch bearing woman in a Hellenic style white robe.  She illuminates a globe and three cherubs, two of which are working on geographic texts while the third supports a large banner bearing the title.  Two further decorative engravings decorate the extreme lower right and lower left hand corners of the map.  The engraving in lower left hand corner of the map consists of a monumental obelisk supporting the armorial crests of Russia’s most important cities, including Moscow, Kiev and Riga.  In the lower right hand corner a gigantic broken Doric column provides the backdrop for a classically garbed woman holding a flag displaying the Imperial Russian Double Eagle in one hand and a map in the other.  She gazes to her right as the Greek god Hermes, reclining upon a cloud, reaches for the flag she holds.  Cannons, armor, and other military paraphernalia lie scattered about in the foreground and sailing ships ply the seas in the background.  All in all, the staggering scope and detail of this map can bear almost limitless study and examination.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Pompeii-SDUK-1832,"Antique Map: 1832 S.D.U.K. City Plan or Map of Pompeii, Italy",Pompeii.,"A beautiful example of the 1832 S.D.U.K. map of Pompeii, Italy.  Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of the volcano Vesuvius, in A.D. 79 and remained buried under ash until its rediscovery in 1748. Though excavations had been in process for nearly 60 years when this map was printed, very little of this ancient Roman city had been unearthed.  The excavated portions of Pompeii, confined to the right hand quadrants of the map, drew the attention of the world as more and more of the fantastically preserved pleasure city was unearthed.  For Englishmen and women visiting Italy as part of the “Grand Tour”, Pompeii was a must see.  The discoveries here, reported by travelers, may have been partially responsible for the classical revival of the mid 19th century. Map shows the walled city of Pompeii with numerous important buildings labeled including the Amphitheater, the Villa of Julia  Felix, the Forum, the Grand Theater, the Temple of Hercules, the Basilica, and the Grand Court, to name but a few.  An inset map in the lower left hand quadrant shows Vesuvius and vicinity.   Another inset set in the “unexcavated” portions of Pompeii, shows the layout of a typical Pompeii villa. A decorative view along the bottom of the map shows the cities as it must have appeared to 19th century travelers.  Above this view are artistic renderings of important Pompeii Buildings.

Covers from Newfoundland south along the New England and Virginia coastlines to the Bahamas (Gigante) and the West Indies, showing parts of Cuba and all of Hispaniola, Porto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, as well as the northern parts of South America from modern day Venezuela to the Orinoco Delta and the Guianas.    As Royal Cartographer to King Louis XIV of France, Coronelli had access to the most recent cartographic records coming from the New World – particularly form the French occupied territories in North America and the West Indies.  Advocating French control of much of North America, Coronelli limits New England  (Nuoua Inghilterra) to the regions immediately surrounding Cape Cod and Boston Harbor.  Similarly, New York (Nuoua Iorck) is confined to the coastal lands near New York City, Connecticut and Long Island.  Though largely supplemented by the British by the time Coronelli drew this map, he recognizes Sweden’s claims to New Sweden (Nuoua Suecia) in the vicinity of Delaware Bay.  The West Indies are drawn with considerable accuracy with notations for cities, ports, islands, and references to the powers that controlled them.  Offers good though somewhat inaccurate detail of South America’s mountain and river systems, particularly the Orinoco.

Also depicts many of the important cod fishing banks between Cape Cod and Newfoundland.   This beautiful gore was originally drawn by Coronelli as part of his fantastic 42 inch “Terresterial Globe”.  Several examples of this magnificent globe are prized today by institutional collections in Europe and America.  Far rarer are the atlases that Coronelli published from his globe gores.

Published in 1854 by Jacob Monk, this large and beautiful wall map, details much of North America from the southern border of Canada to Central America, the West Indies, and the northwestern parts of South America.  Details the United States in full as well as parts of modern day Canada.    Shows North America during an important period of territorial and cultural expansion following the Mexican-American war and during height of the California Gold Rush.   The California Gold Region around Sacramento, nestled between the Sierra Nevada’s and the Coastal Ranges, is highlighted in bright yellow.  Despite Monk’s bold highlight of the Gold Region it remains surprisingly inaccurate.  Monk places Auburn well north of Sacramento between Marysville and Yuba City.  Shows the western territories as they existed at the time with New Mexico extending from California to Texas, Utah reaching from California to Kansas, and Washington and Oregon extending eastward to Nebraska Territory. Nebraska Territory itself is shown at its fullest extent from Kansas to the border with British  America (Canada).  Oklahoma is divided up among three American Indian Nations, the Chah-Lah-Kee, the Muscogee, and the Chah-Ta.  Also names numerous other American Indian tribes throughout.  Shows several wagon routes and proposed railroads, as well as springs, mountain passes, forests, swamps, and deserts.  Attempts to illustrate the shipping lanes along both the east and west coasts with numerous vignettes showing sailing ships.  A large inset map in the lower left quadrant shows the world on a Mercator Projection.  To the right of this is a chart detailing the towns and counties of the United States. Surrounded by an elaborate decorative border with a floral, almost baroque motif.  This is the fourth state of Monk’s map which was first published in 1854.  Monk issued two variants of this map in 1854, an earlier version that, similar to the 1853 issue, showed Nebraska as “proposed Territory of Nebraska” and this version, issued following the ratification of Nebraska Territory in May of 1854, which drops “proposed” and ads a note regarding the establishment of the territory.  All in all an extremely beautiful and interesting wall map of North America.  This is the kind of map that can stand up to lengthy perusal.",1854 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/monk.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/AmerNorth-monk-1854.jpg,AmerNorth-monk-1854,60,56

F. Hall on his Franklin Research Expeditions during the years of 1860 - 61 - 62.,"This is a rare and fascinating 1864 map of Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island and the Davis Straits, Canada prepared to illustrate the explorations and discoveries of Charles Francis Hall.  Hall is a fascinating figure in Arctic Exploration.  In 1860 Hall, at the time a Newspaper publisher, became obsessed with the idea of rescuing the missing Arctic expedition of English nobleman Sir John Franklin.  Despite a lack of substantial funding or experience in the Arctic, Hall set out for Greenland with the plan to use local guides and techniques to aid in his explorations.  The full story of Hall’s fascinating adventures cannot be contained here, nonetheless, after several years in the Arctic, he did in fact discover the sad fate of Franklin’s expedition – starvation and death.  This however was not his most notable achievement.  Rather, it is his correctly identifying Frobisher Strait as a Bay on Baffin Island.  The English navigator Martin Frobisher first explored this area in 1576 in the search of a Northwest Passage.  He described the discovery of a large body of open water to the west of Baffin Island.  Desirous of a Northwest Passage, Frobisher assumed that the Bay was in fact a strait separating Baffin Island from another unknown island.  It was not until Hall explored the area in 1860 that it became clear that Baffin Island was much larger than presumed and that the supposed “strait” was little more than a large bay.  This is consequently one of the first published maps to show this Arctic region with relative accuracy.  Published to supplement C. F. Hall's account of the “Franklin Research Expedition” in 1865.",1864 (dated 1860 - 61 - 62),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/cfhall.txt,"Hall, C.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Florida-landsurvey-1849,Antique Map: 1848 Land Survey Map of Florida,A Plat Exhibiting the State of the Surveys in the State of Florida with References.,"An extremely rare variant state of the 1849 Land Survey Map of Florida.  Geographically this map corresponds to the 1848 Butler issue of this map, but bears the Putnam imprint and 1849 date overprinting an earlier date of October and Butler’s imprint. Consequently this map was likely issued shortly after the transition from Butler to Putnam in the office of Surveyor General, yet before Putnam was able to create his own distinctive maps.   This map represents the state of the Land Survey in Florida as of  September 30, 1849.  Shows the state divided into several hundred numbered plats, some of which are marked with an “S” to state that they had been fully surveyed, and some with a “T” suggesting that they had only been surveyed externally.  Labels several important Seminole War Forts including Fort Bassinger, Fort Center, Fort Thompson, Fort Beynaud, Fort Adams, and others.  Notes the Everglades, Big Cypress, Fort Lauderdale, Lake Okeechobee, and many of Florida’s lakes and river systems.  Also shows both the Arredondo Grant and Forbes Purchase.  The Arredondo Grant is a layover of the Spanish Land Grant program, which bequeathed it to a powerful Spanish merchant - Arredondo. With incredible difficulty and protest, the land grants were dissolved when Florida became part of the United States. Forbes Purchase refers to a large tract of land in the Florida Panhandle that was purchased from Spain by three American traders in the late 18th century. After Florida became part of the United States there was an attempt by the government to seize this land, but it was shot down by the United States Supreme Court. Unfortunately, as Forbes Purchase was mostly uninhabitable swampland, it was impossible to develop and later sold off in lots.  The map is dated to 1849 and attributed to R. A. Putnam, Surveyor General.   However, this map is very similar to Robert Butler’s 1848 map and, in fact, there seems to be some over printing on the date and name.  Upon close examination a date of “Oct” seems to be printed under the more readable “Sept”, and the name “Robert Butler” under R. A. Putnam.   Most likely this is a printer’s mistake, a confusion between Rufus Putnam, who served as Surveyor General under George Washington, and, Major Benjamin Putnam served as Surveyor General of Florida from 1849 to 1851.  Later states of this map correct the imprint to B.A. Putnam.","September 30, 1849 (dated)",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/landoffice.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Florida-landsurvey-1849.jpg,Florida-landsurvey-1849,25.5,22

Drawn by the French artist Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues c. 1565 and published by Theodore de Bry in 1591, this magnificent map details the Florida peninsula and Carolina coast from Cuba to the Bahamas, to “Prom Terra flag” or, as it is known today, Cape Lookout near Beaufort, North Carolina.   The fascinating story of this map begins with the ambitions of the influential Huguenot Admiral Gaspard de Coligny.  De Coligny, desirous of a French foothold on the American mainland sent the talented navigator Jean Ribaut to establish a colony.  In 1562 Ribaut landed near the mouth of the St. John River, which he named F. Maij after the month in which he landed.  Ribaut and his crew then sailed north along the coast until they discovered a large bay which they named Port Royal.  Here they landed and established Charlefort after King Charles IX of France.   This is the first mention of Port Royal on any map and is, along with Prom. Canaueral (Cape Canaveral), the only two sites in Florida to retain their French names through the following centuries of Spanish and English dominance.   Having successfully established Charlefort, Ribaut returned to France to bring additional settlers and supplies.  There he discovered his homeland to be in the midst of a religious war between the Catholic house of Valois and the Huegonot house of Bourbon, with whom he was associated.  The conflict took Ribaut to England where involvement in a political plot saw him imprisoned.    Meanwhile in less than a year the colony of Charlefort, beset by famine, an aggressive indigenous population, and a lack of supplies mutinied.  Constructing a small adhoc sailing craft, the fifty or so mutinous settlers attempted to return to France.  Lacking a proper navigator or notable sailing skills, the settlers would surely have died at sea had they not been picked up by a passing English ship.   By 1564, a tentative peace had been established in France and, not one to see his ambitions thwarted, Admiral De Coligny planed a second expedition to the New World.  With Ribaut imprisoned in England, De Coligny chose an under commander on the first voyage, Rene de Laudonniere, to lead the second expedition.  Laudonniere landed and set up a settlement along the F. Maij (River May or St. John’s River) which he named Carolina.  This second expedition also included the prominent French artist Jacques Le Moyne, who was commissioned to record and map as much of the region as possible  Back in Europe, Ribaut had been released from prison and Coligny sent him, along with several ships and some 200 soldiers, to take command of the Carolina settlement.  By this time the Catholic King of Spain, having heard about the French colony, dispatched the newly appointed Governor of Florida, Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, with orders to remove the “Heretic  French”.    After a brief skirmish with Ribaut’s ships, Menéndez de Avilés sailed south and established St. Augustine, the first permanent European settlement on the North American mainland.  From St. Augustine, Menéndez de Avilés marched his troops overland to Carolina where they destroyed the fort and, in a shocking display of violence, slaughtered most of the settlers, including Ribuat.    Laudonniere, Le Moyne, a few others managed to escape through the surrounding swamps and forests.  Catching an English ship, the small group eventually made it to London where Le Moyne ultimately settled.",1591 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/debry.txt,"Le Moyne de Morgues, J., <i>Brevis Narratio Eorum Quae in Florida Americae Provicia</i>, in De Bry, J., <i>Grands Voyages</i>, part II, 1591 edition.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Florida-debry-1591.jpg,Florida-debry-1591,18,14
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/CANMUT-johnson-1862,"Antique Map: 1862 Johnson Map of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona","Johnson's California, Territories of New Mexico and Utah.","One of the scarcest and most historically significant of A. J. Johnson’s southwest series.  Published in 1862 at the height of the American Civil War, this stunning map depicts the state of California and the territories of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona.  Representing the third state of the Johnson southwest map, this map varies most significantly from its 1861 predecessor in the addition of a clearly defined Arrizona (yes, with 2 “r”s) Territory.   In 1861 “Arrizona” was an alternate name for the lands added to the New Mexico territory by the 1854 Gadsden Purchase.  With only a small population and minimal political influence this region was largely ignored by the New Mexico territorial government in distant Sante Fe.  Arizona applied several times to be granted independent territorial status, but its low population caused the request to be repeatedly denied.  At the outbreak of the Civil War, Arizonans saw an opportunity to appeal to an alternate body for the political needs of the region and through their lot in with the secessionist southern states.  Around this time the Union began to withdraw troops from the region in fear that Sante Fe would be attacked by Confederate soldiers operating out of Texas.  In Texas itself Col. John Robert Baylor, recognizing a strategic opportunity, led his troops into Southern Arizona.  In a series of brilliant tactical manauvers, Baylor defeated the much large Union garrison and seized Fort Fillmore and Messilla. Shortly thereafter Baylor declared himself Territorial Governor of the Confederate Territory of Arizona including “all that portion of New Mexico lying south of the thirty-fourth parallel of north latitude.” The Confederate Territory of Arizona lasted less than a year before it was seized by the Union Army and dismantled in favor of the current configuration with the Arizona – New Mexico border situated along a north-south axis.  This is one of the few maps issued during this short and politically volatile period to specifically depict the Confederate Territory of Arizona.  Also varies from the previous state of the map in that the California – Nevada border has been corrected to a straight line between Pyramid Peak (where several Mormon settlements are noted) and Fort Moliare.  Elsewhere on the map, Utah and Arizona are split up along the 116th meridian, far west of where it sits today.  Fillmore City is shows as the capital of Utah though Salt Lake City also appears.  In Colorado the Gold Region near Colorado City is prominently depicted.  Throughout, this map is full of interesting and sometimes erroneous notations regarding natural features, Native American tribes, proposed railroads, mail routes, explorer’s tracks, and treaty lines.  In the highly desertous region near modern day Quartzite, Arizona, a note reads “in the vicinity of this place a tract of country is found which is said by Trappers to be exceedingly and fertile and abundantly timbered and well watered.”   Johnson also notes silver deposits in this same region.  “Vegas” appears roughly in its current location though at the time there was little there but a natural water source and an abandoned Mormon fort.  The famed Pony Express Route is delineated as it passes through Nebraska, Utah, and Nevada on its way to California.   All in all, this is an extraordinarily example of one of the scarcest and most desirable maps of the American Southwest.  Published by A. J.

Showing the extent of the powerful Mughal Empire in the late 17th century, this map details the subcontinent and parts of Central Asia from Persia and Khandhar eastward as far a modern day Burma and Thailand.  Extends northward to include parts of Tibet and Nepal and southwards as far as the Malabar Coast and the Gulf of Thailand.  Cartographically this map is heavily based upon Hondius and Mercator’s 17th century of the same region entitled  India Orientalis .   Presented is wonderful combination of surprising accuracy, gross errors, and outright speculation.    Generally speaking, this map is cartographically solid detailing numerous cities, river systems and trade routes.  Shows Deli, Agra, Kandahar (Candahar), Lahore (Lahor), Pegu, Goa, Kabul (Cabul), Jaisalmer (Gislemere), and many other important and still thriving cities.  Also notes several important trade routes including the ancient caravan trail westward from Agra into Persia.  Despite this map’s thoroughness, there are a number of cartographic errors, probably the most notable of which is the narrowing of the subcontinent.  Usually such lateral misrepresentations are the result of erroneous 16th century longitudinal calculations.  In this case, these errors found their way into the Hondius’s map and hence into this one as well.  The northernmost regions depicted on this map are highly speculative with regard to physical geography.    A number of large lakes, including the apocryphal Lake of Chiamay, are speculated in the northeastern quadrants of the map as the sources of four important Southeast Asian river systems including the Irrawaddy, the Dharla, the Chao Phraya, and the Brahmaputra.     The curious Lake of Chiamay (also called Chiam-may or Chian-may), roughly located in the area of Assam but sometimes as far north as Tibet and China, began to appear in maps of this region as early as the 16th century and persisted well into the mid 18th century.  Its origins are unknown but may originate in a lost 16th century geography prepared by the Portuguese scholar Jao de Barros.  It was speculated to be the source of five important Southeast Asian River systems and was mentioned in the journals of Sven Hedin.  There are even records that the King of Siam led an invasionary force to take control of the lake in the 16th century.   Nonetheless, the theory of  Lake Chimmay was ultimately disproved and it disappeared from maps entirely by the 1760s.   Decorated with several extremely attractive allegorical cartouche image.  The title cartouche in the lower left hand quadrant shows Poseidon, Hermes, an angel and the goddess Fame admiring the wealth of Asia as represented by jewels, ivory, and precious metals.  In the upper left hand quadrant, a distance scale plays second fiddle to a scene of cherubs rummaging through chests full of treasure while exotic peacocks look on.  A large trade Caravel rests in the Indian Ocean, lower right quadrant, suggesting the trade riches to be had by daring ship captains willing to sail half way around the world.

This rare map offers a fascinating snapshot of this secessionist state shortly following the outbreak of the American Civil War.   Map shows the state in full with color coding according to county.   Cartographically this map is probably based on U.S. Land Survey charts commissioned in the mid 1850s.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Edinburgh-craig-1768,"Antique Map: 1768 James Craig Map of  New Town, Edinburgh, Scotland (First Plan of New Town)",Plan of the New Streets and Squares intended for the city of Edinburgh.,"Drafted for the city planning committee in 1768 by James Craig, this is the definitive plan of Edinburgh, Scotland’s New Town.  Oriented to the North, this plan details the streets of Edinburgh north of the Loch Nor (today the Prince’s Street Gardens) between St. George’s Square (modern day Charlotte Square) and St. Andrews Square. A dedication to King George the III illustrates the lower part of the map.  An elaborate title cartouche decorates the lower left hand quadrant.  Thompson’s poem appears in a  secondary cartouche at the top center.    In 1766 the City Fathers of Edinburgh lead by Lord Provost George Drummond instituted a plan to extend the city’s border to encompass the field’s north of the Nor Loch.   The plan, intended to modernize the city and ease the crowded conditions of the old Royal Burgh, was turned into a competition.  James Craig, an Edinburgh native, having around this time just completed his apprenticeship as a mason, found the he had a fine hand for drafting.  Inspired by his uncle James Thomson’s well known poem  Liberty ,    August, around, what Public Works I see, Lo’ stately Streets, lo’ Squares that Court the breeze, See’ long Canals, and deepened Rivers join Eash part with each, and with the circling Main The whole enlivened Isle…   Craig submitted this plan.  Though conservative in its vision, Craig’s plan won the city’s design contest and he was awarded with the “Freedom of the City” in 1767.  Sadly the Lord Provost George Drummond who instituted the contest died before his dream of expanding the city was realized.  It was left to his successor, the Lord Provost Gilbert Laurie, who is named on this map, to realize Craig’s plan.  Today the streets are laid out much as Craig envisioned them with broad east –west avenues separating housing blocks bisected by smaller mews.   Drawn by James Craig and engraved by P. Begbie in 1768. When this plan was printed in 1768, only 500 were issued.  With such a small printing run as an independently issued map, we can safely assume that very few examples, other than the one you see here, have survived to this day.  Only one recorded example of this map has appeared at auction in the last 30 years.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/UnitedStates-webster-1835,Antique Map: 1835 Webster Map of the United States,Map of the United States.,"An exceptional and rare map of the United States published by James Webster in 1835.  Extends from the east coast of the United States westward as far as the Rocky Mountains, including much of Texas.  This map of the United States is heavily based upon Humphrey Phelps’ 1832 map of the same name.  In fact, a close examination of the copyright data in the lower right hand corner seem to suggest that Webster simply scratched out Phelps’ name and the date 1832, in order to replace it with his own and the date 1834. We can assume that Webster must have either picked up a discarded Phelps plate, purchased the plate, or simply stole it.   One of the most elegant features of this map is the portrait of George Washington engraved as part of the title cartouche in the lower right hand quadrant.  Probably the work of the prominent engraver William Chapin, whose name appears just to the right of Florida, this charming portrait is a remarkable piece of engraving.  To achieve this result Chapin combines several different engraving styles, including an attractive application of both stipple and line technique.  Cartographically offers numerous elements of interest.  Predates the formation of the Republic of Texas by one year, however does mention the region while including with Mexico.  Much of the western part of this map is dominated by an expansive Missouri Territory extending from Texas north to British America (Canada) and west as far as the Rocky Mountains.    Shows the course and numerous tributaries of the Missouri River as well numerous American Indian tribes throughout the region.  Also shows the smaller Missouri State as it was admitted to the Union in 1821.  To the south Arkansas remains a territory though it would join only one year later in 1836.  Wisconsin Territory appears with the archaic French spelling “Ouisconsin,” and includes Michigan’s northern peninsula.  Lake Michigan itself is slightly malformed and distended on the vertical axis.  At the bottom center there is a population chart for each stat and many major cities.  Removed from but accompanied by its original binder in which we also find attached a fold out “Traveller’s Guide and Statistical View of the United States”. Here Webster again seems to have used a bit of legerdemain in absconding with and copyrighting in his own name S. A. Mitchell’s 1832 “Traveller’s Guide”.  Offers road distances, notes on boat routes, and population statistics for the entire United States.  The population chart notes whites, “free blacks”, and slaves.  Further notes illness and infirmities.  For example there were 650 deaf and dumb slaves in 1830.  A truly remarkable compilation of data.  Both  the map and the index sheet are signed by one J. E. Geiger, of whom we can find no significant reference. We cannot stress enough the rarity of this particular publication.  David Rumsey, who has the 1836 edition, assumed it was “one shot issue”.

Though the unpredictable waters off Nantucket were long a nemesis to sailing vessels on the important London – New York shipping routes, they had never been properly charted.  The harsh conditions, including rapid unexpected swells and frequent heavy fog, contrived to make the hydrographic survey of the hazards south of Nantucket one of the most dangerous and challenging projects of the early coast survey.    The first survey party to tackle this area was lead by the indomitable Lieutenant Commanding Charles H. Davis.  Starting at Old South Shoal, a known danger, Davis worked his way southward and soon discovered “New South Shoal”, which was later renamed “Davis Shoal” in his honor.  Working seasonally, it took the Coast Survey to 1853, fully seven years, to complete the survey of the Old South Shoal and Davis’ Shoal.    The outline map of Nantucket, appearing in the upper left hand quadrant, is based upon a map prepared by William Mitchell, a Nantucket local and life long friend of Bache.  This outline of map of Nantucket would continue to grace the upper left corner of the U.S. Coast Survey “Davis Shoal” sheets until the late 1850s.  Prepared by Charles H.

Par G. de l'Isle de l'Academie Royale des Sciences. A Amsterdam, Chez Jean Covens et Corneille Mortier, Geographes.","An extraordinary example of Covens and Mortier’s c. 1730 issue of De L’Isle’s important c. 1707 map of Africa south of the Equator.  Depicts the southern Africa in stunning detail with numerous notations an comments regarding the people, geography, and wildlife of the region.  De L’lsle was very a cautious and scientific cartographer, basing his maps on the first hand reports from sailors, merchants and missionaries that, at the time, were flowing into Paris at an unprecedented rate.  This map offers significant detail throughout the interior naming numerous tribal areas and kingdoms including the Jaga, the Kongo, the Angola, the Kingdom of Numeamaie or Mono-Emugi, Monomotapa, Gingiro, and others.  Shows the Portuguese trading colonies of Sena and Tete (Santiago) on the Zambezi River.   Also near the Zambezi, La Victoire Couvent de Dominicains is worth of mention. Also notes the predominantly Arab island kingdoms of Pemba and Zanzibar.  Identifies the Dutch colonies near the Cape of Good Hope, including “Fort Hollandois” (Cape Town).    Near the Equator, De L’Isle identifies an enormous lake almost exactly in the modern location and form of Lake Victoria.  He notes that this is a “ Grand Lac place sur le raport des Negres .”  What is remarkable about this is not the appearance of a lake in this region, one of the two Ptolemaic sources of the Nile appeared on maps of this area for hundreds of years, but rather that it seems to be based on actual evidence and it is not connected to any of the great African river systems.  It seems highly likely that this is one of the first clear references to Lake Victoria to appear on a map.  The condition of  this  map bears special mention.  We have rarely encountered an antique map from any era in such outstanding condition.  The condition of the paper, the quality of the engraving, and the overall state of preservation of this map is beyond compare.

This is Covens and Mortier's c. 1730 reissue of Guillaume de L'Isle's magnificent c. 1708 map of this region.  The northern sheet covers from Costa Rica and Barbados south roughly to the Tropic of Capricorn or more precisely 50 degrees south latitude.  Southern sheet covers roughly from 18 degrees south latitude south to Tierra del Fuego.  Both maps are notable for their extraordinary condition with a dark strong impression on clean white paper.  Early 18th century maps rarely appear in this superb condition.  The northern sheet of this set, like most early maps of the area, contrasts a detailed mapping of the coast with a speculative discussion of the interior, particularly the Amazon Basin.  Offers a fairly accurate mapping of both the east and west coasts with exceptional detail in the populated Andean regions of Columbia, Ecuador (Labeled Quito), and Peru.   Notes Cuzco, Lima, Quito, Valladolid, Arequipa, Trujillo and other important trading centers of the region.  In Portuguese controlled Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, San Salvador and San Sebastian are noted.  Lake Maracaibo, in modern day Venezuela, is slightly malformed and elongated.  The interior is where this map gets interesting.  De L’lsle was a cautious and scientific cartographer, who based his maps on the first hand reports from sailors, merchants and missionaries that, at the time, were flowing into Paris at an unprecedented rate.  Consequently many of his maps offer significant cartographic advances over their predecessors.  This map is no exception and De L'Isle credits the mappings and explorations of Alonzo de Herrera, Johannes de Laet, P.P. D Acuna and M. Rodriguez.   Nonetheless, De L'Isle's mapping of South America's interior is full of inaccuracy, curiosities, and ample fodder for the gold hunting European.    Our survey of this map begins with De L'Isle's impressively accurate mapping of the Amazon and Orinoco River systems - though he does erroneously connect the two, an understandable error common to maps of the period.  Roughly where the Grand Sabana is today, in modern day Venezuela, De L'Isle speculates the location of Lake Parima and the city of El Dorado (curiously this is actually gold rich region though difficult to access and mine).  Further South he notates numerous gold rich indigenous groups including Los Plateros and Xarayes.    The Xarayes, a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River, were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal.  When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation.   Understandably misinterpreting  the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies.  The Laguna de los Xarayes almost immediately began to appear on early maps of the region and, at the same time, almost immediately took on a legendary aspect.   Later missionaries and chroniclers, particularly Díaz de Guzmán, imagined an island in this lake and curiously identified it as an Island of Paradise,  ...an island [of the Paraguay River] more than ten leagues [56 km] long, two or three [11-16 km] wide. A very mild land rich in a thousand types of wild fruit, among them grapes, pears and olives: the Indians created plantations throughout, and throughout the year sow and reap with no difference in winter or summer,  ... the Indians of that island are of good will and are friends to the Spaniards; Orejón they call them, and they have their ears pierced with wheels of wood ... which occupy the entire hole. They live in round houses, not as a village, but each apart though keep up with each other in much peace and friendship. They called of old this island Land of Paradise for its abundance and wonderful qualities.",c. 1730 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/covensmortier.txt,"Covens, J. & Mortier, C., <i>Atlas nouveau, contenant toutes les parties su Monde, ou sont exactement remarquees les empires, monarchies, royaumes, etats, republiques, &c.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Carolina-speed-1676,Antique Map: 1676 John Speed Map of Carolina,A New Description of Carolina.,"A beautiful example  of John Speed's important 1676 map of the Carolina colony.   Heavily based upon the explorations of John Lederer and Ogilby's Lords Proprietor's Map of 1674.  This seminal map represents one of the earliest attempts to map the Carolina interior.    Oriented to the West, map covers from the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, Florida, north to Jamestown, Virginia.  Extends inland as far as the Appellation (Apalathean) Mountains.   By the middle of the 17th century the coast of Carolina had been fairly well mapped , St. Augustine, Port Royal, Charleston (Charles Town), Cape Fear, Cape Lookout, Cape Hatteras, Roanoke, Cape Henry and the James River are all shown with a fair approximation of accuracy.  We see ample evidence of the Lords Proprietors including Albemarl County, Clarendon County, Berkley County, Craven County, etc.  This map also incorporates numerous elements from earlier maps including Lake Sarrope,  which was identified by the De Bry - Le Moyne map of 1565 and most likely represents Lake Okeechobee.   Also shows the River May (historically either the St. John's River or the Savannah River, depending on the map).    Where this map really gets interesting is the interior, which is heavily based upon the explorations of John Lederer in the 1670s.  Lederer, a German physician who had moved to the colony several  years before was commissioned by the Lord Proprietor, Anthony Ashley Cooper (Earl of  Shaftesbury), to explore the interior in search of a pass beyond the mountains to the Pacific.  As the time it was commonly assumed that the mainland of North America was a relatively narrow strip of land that could be traversed swiftly easily to access the rich trade opportunities of the Pacific.   Though Lederer never managed to cross the Appellations, he did undertake three voyages which significantly impacted cartography in this region for several hundred years.     Today Lederer is highly criticized for fabricating much of his journey and a cursory examination of the map will reveal what might seem to be several gross cartographic errors, including a great savanna in the Piedmont, the Deserta Arensa, and Ashley  Lake in the north.  Lederer's route is roughly traced on this map as he heads almost directly west from the Falls of the James River before turning southwest at the Mahock village (near Richmond).  Keeping to a southwesterly course, Lederer passes a great savanna on his right and ultimately finds himself on the shores of Ashley Lake (which he calls Ushery and which on our map corresponds with the Great Freshwater Lake of the American Southwest popularized by the 1606 Mercator - Hondius Map).  At this point Lederer returns along a parallel but more easterly course passing through a great sandy desert, the Deserta Arenosa, before returning to known lands.     Many scholars have argued that Lederer simply lied about many of his findings, but we find that much of what he said, when taken in the context of lonely explorer traversing an unknown land several hundred years ago, has merit.     Lederer's desert, the Arenosa, probably corresponds the Sand Hills region, though he does slightly exaggerate the scope.   Some scholars criticize the desert as, according to his narrative Lederer spent several days on the desert before encountering water.  Given the geography of the Sand Hills as we know it, it would seem likely that he would have such difficulty finding water, but his placement of the desert compared with the actual placement of the Sand Hills remains convincing.    The savanna in the piedmont region is non-existent today, though something very much like this may have existed in Lederer's day.   Lederer describes this savanna as marish grounds at the foot of the Apalataei.",1676 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/speed.txt,"Speed, J., <i>The Theater of the Empire of Great Britian</i>, 1676.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/AmericaWest-zatta-1776,Antique Map: 1776 Zatta Map of California and the Western Parts of North America,"Nuove Scoperte De'Russi al Nord del Mare del Sud si nell'Asia, che nell'America","An exceptionally stunning example of Antonio Zatta's 1776 map of the northwestern parts of America and the northeastern parts of Asia.  This map is one of the most sought after and decorative 18th century pre-Cook maps of the Pacific Northwest ever issued.  Covers the region from the Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes westward as far as Siberia and Japan, north well into the Arctic, and southwards as far as Cabo San Lucas in Baja California.  In this stunning map, Zatta, combining almost every 17th and 18th century myth and fact of the American west into a single map, offers up a veritable smorgasbord of speculative geography.   The idea of a Northwest Passage linking the Hudson Bay to the Pacific is central to this map.  In this Zatta embraces the speculative geography advocated by Nicholas De L'Isle and Phillipe Bauche.  De L'Isle and Bauche were supporters of the  Northwest Passage theory associated with the apocryphal voyage of the 17th century Admiral de Fonte.   The De Fonte legend first appeared in a 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”.  This short-lived magazine published a previously unknown account by a supposed Spanish Admiral named Bartholomew de Fonte.   De Fonte is said to have sailed up the Pacific coast of North America in 1640.   On this voyage he apparently discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward from the Pacific towards Hudson Bay. The De Fonte story relates how, on one of these great inland lakes, he met with a westward bound ship from Boston that must to have come through the Northwest Passage.  Today, based upon inaccuracies and falsities, we know the entire De Fonte article to have been a fabrication, however, it set 18th century afire with speculation that a Northwest Passage must indeed exist.  Even such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin wrote long defenses of De Fonte.  Our map details De Fonte's route from the Straight of Anian eastward past Lake Velasco, Lake Bello and the Lac de Fonte into another great lake, the Michinipi and hence the Hudson Bay.   On the way, De Fonte passes both the Straights of Anian, presumably a misinterpretation of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and further on,  the Kingdom of Anian.  Anian or Anian Regnum appeared on maps from the 16th through the early 19th centuries.  The idea of Anian was derived from Rasmusio's 1559 edition of Marco Polo's travels which describes Ania or Anan as a Chinese province accessed via a watery straight.  Some speculate that this may have referred to the New World, though Polo himself places it somewhere near India.  Anian's, first cartographic appearance was only a few years later in a 1562 map by Giacomo Gastaldi.  Gastaldi seems to be the man responsible for Anian's presence in the New World.  The idea was embraced by other cartographers and intellectuals of the period.     John Donne sums the idea up in a poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.”  Both the Kingdom of Anian and the Straight of Anian on our Zatta map.   Just south of the Strait of Anian, Zatta includes Fou-Sang which he describes as a Chinese Colony.   Fusang of Fousang is a region first documented by the Chinese Buddhist missionary Hui  Shen in the 5th century.  Hui  Shen describes a land some 20,000 Chinese Li (c. 8000 km) east  of the China coast.  Fousang is described in considerable detail in the 7th century  Book of Liang  by Yao Silian.  There are also accounts that the land was settled c. 220 BC by a  Chinese Emperor of the Han Dynasty.   In later days Fusang was commonly used in Chinese poetry to designate Japan, however earlier references keep it distinct.  In any case, Hui Shen's description of Fusang with regard to distance and geography, corresponds more with the coastlands of North America than with Japan. The French historian Joseph de Guignes in  his 1761article Le Fou-Sang des Chinois est-il l'Amérique?  promoted this idea.",1776 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/zatta.txt,"Zatta, A., <i>Atlante novissimo</i>, 1776.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/AmericaWest-zatta-1776.jpg,AmericaWest-zatta-1776,16.5,12.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SouthPole-covensmortier-1741,"Antique Map: 1741 Covens and Mortier Map of the Southern Hemisphere ( South Pole, Antarctic)",L'Hemisphere Meridional pour voir plus distinctement Les Terres Australes.,"This is a stunning map of the Southern Hemisphere originally drawn by Guillaume de L'Isle and updated in 1739 by Covens and Mortier.  Extends from the South Pole northwards in all directions as far as the Equator, encompassing in the process most of South America, southern Africa, Australia, and parts of the East Indies including Borneo, New Guinea, Java and Sumatra.   Details the routes taken by numerous explorers including Magellan, Vespucci, Mendana, Dampier, L'Aigle, S. Louis, Halley, Quiros, Maire, Tasman, Davis and others.  Many of the updates to this map over earlier versions focus on the explorations of Lozier de Bouvet.  An account of Bouvet's explorations appears on both sides of the map proper - in French on the left and in Dutch on the right.   Bouvet explored the Antarctic seas in the late 1730s.  In January of 1739 Bouvet discovered an iceberg ridden sea and sighted an outcropping of land he called Cap de la Circoncision.  Based upon Bouvet's calculations this would have been the southernmost point of land ever sighted.  At the time, and for roughly 100 years previous, geographers had speculated on the existence of a Southern Continent.  The idea of such a continent was based on a theory of balance.  Geographers theorized that the weight of Asia had to be counter balanced by a similarly massive continent in the extreme South.  The great proponent of this theory in the 18th century was Geographer to the King and Académie des Sciences member Philippe Buache de la Neuville.   Bauche was the preeminent geographical theorist of his day and used Lozier's discoveries to promote his own ideas of a Southern Continent.   Thus, returning to our map, we see evidence of Bauchian Antarctic theory in the inset detail of Cap de la Circoncision in the lower right quadrant.  Bauche would later theorize that the Cap was actually attached to a great continent further south and that it was the outlet for a large Antarctic Sea.   After Lozier de Bouvet, subsequent explorers had a great deal of difficulty finding Cap de  la  Circoncision.  In the late 18th century Captain Cook searched for the Cap extensively on both his first and second voyages.  One of Cook's associates, Captain Furneaux also searched the area with little success. The issue seems to have been a miscalculation by Bouvet regarding Longitude (a typical problem at the time) that placed the island about 23 degrees too far east.  The land was finally rediscovered by Captain James Lindsay in 1808 who realized that it was in fact an island and not attached to a greater southern landmass.   It was sighted again by the American whaling Captain Benjamin Morrell in 1822 who renamed it Bouvet's Island in honor of its original discoverer.   On to other parts of the map.  De L'Isle, based on only the sketchiest knowledge of the region obtained from the voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman around Australia, maps Australia, or in this case Terres Australes, as attached to both Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) and New Guinea.   Despite this, the western parts of Australia are drawn with relative accuracy while  the eastern portions are postulated with a dotted line.    South America, roughly three quarters of which appears here, is well mapped along its shores though speculatively in the interior.   Our map shows the Laguna de los Xarayes and the lands of the Xarayes, a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River.  The Xaraiés were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies.",c. 1741 (dated 1739),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/covensmortier.txt,"Covens, J. & Mortier, C., <i>Atlas nouveau, contenant toutes les parties su Monde, ou sont exactement remarquees les empires, monarchies, royaumes, etats, republiques, &c.

Covers from the North Pole south in all directions to include the Arctic Regions, all of North American, Central America, Asia, and Europe with parts of South America and most of Africa.  To either side of the map proper (in French on left side and in Dutch on right side) is a letter written by Monsieur Swartz, a Danish explorer in the service of the Tzar, regarding his c. 1734 - 1740 explorations near Japan and Kamchatka.  Covens and Mortier's most interesting updates over the De L'Isle version of this map relate to explorations in North America and in East Asia.   North America is drawn as it appeared at the height of the Colonial period.  English colonies skirt the east coast, the French control the Great Lakes regions and Louisiana, and the Spanish dominate in Mexico, California and the Southwest.  California is drawn connected to the mainland with a dotted line - indicating that European map publishers were not yet prepared to give up on the idea that California may indeed be an Island.   Names the city of Quivara, which is one of the lands associated with Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold.  Also notes the Sioux and the Apalache peoples.   As befits De L'Isle's scientific approach to cartographer much of the unexplored northwest of America remains blank.   By contrast the northeast parts of Asia, which had recently been explored by Vitus Bering and Tschirikow, offer a number of interesting elements.    The land of Compagnie is shown just the east of Yedso (likely Hokkaido) with a note regarding its mysterious discovery by Jean de Gama.  Often called de Gamma Land  or Gama, this island was supposedly discovered in the 17th century by a mysterious figure known as Jean de Gama. Various subsequent navigators claim to have seen this land, but it was left to Bering to finally debunk the myth.  In 1729, he sailed for three days looking for Juan de Gama land but never found it. Thought it may be little more than a mis-mapping of Hokkaido or the Japanese Kuriles, Gama or Compagnie remained on maps for about 50 years following Bering's voyages until the explorations of Cook confirmed the Bering findings.   Japan itself is only vaguely mapped though Edo (Yendo) is indicated.  Just to the west the Peninsula of Korea is drawn with a fairly accurate if slightly bulbous form.  Further south Formosa and the Philippines are well mapped.

Shows marshes,  tanneries, the rope walks, the tar house, water sources, hills and housing.  While we are uncertain who originally drew this map, we can make some conjectures regarding its date and origins. The map ostensibly depicts the Collect Pond area in 1793, about five years before Fitch tested one of the first steamboats on the  Pond and about twenty years before the Collect was finally filled in.  A note in the lower right corner notes that modern streets have been ghosted in with dotted lines. The street configuration and the presence of the Halls of Justice (also known as the Tombs), lets us date this between 1835 and 1850.  This would have been at the heights of the Five Points slum period described by Martin Scorsese's in the 2002 film,  Gangs of New York .  The Five Points slum, which appeared in the 1830s after the Collect Pond was filled in for health reasons, was one of history's most desperate slums.  In the late 19h century, after over 80 years of infamy, the Five Points were leveled and redeveloped much as it is today.  We can only speculate on why this map was drawn and who drew it.  Stylistically, it bears some resemblance to school girl maps, which were common in  the period, though the subject matter would have been unlikely in this context.  It also bears some similarity to surveyor's manuscripts in regard to the detail in  which it is laid out, but the lack of measurements belies the possibility that it may be one. We have found a few printed maps of the Collect Pond and Five Points which are similar, most notably a map that accompanied a broadside asserting the claims of Fitch over Fulton as the inventor of the steamboat,  but none that correspond exactly.  If this map were in fact a prototype for later printed maps, we have not been able to identify an exact map which may have been descended from it.  Even so, this is a rare and unique piece and a valuable part of the Five Point history.",c. 1840 (dated 1793)_,,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CollectPond-fivepoints-1793.jpg,CollectPond-fivepoints-1793,10.5,13.5

Depicts the entire world on a double hemisphere projection.   North America appears with a fair approximation of accuracy though the western and northwestern regions remain either blank or entirely speculative.  Alaska is entirely absent, but the Aleutian archipelago  does appear in an embryonic form.   By contrast the northeast parts of Asia, which had recently been explored by Vitus Bering and Tschirikow, are depicted with a fair approximation of accuracy. Both the apocryphal Terre de Gama and Terre de la Company appear just northeast of Yedso (Hokkaido). Often called de Gamma Land or Gama, these islands were supposedly discovered in the 17th century by a mysterious figure known as Jean de Gama. Various subsequent navigators claim to have seen this land, but it was left to Bering to finally debunk the myth. In 1729, he sailed for three days looking for Juan de Gama land but never found it. Thought it may be little more than a mis-mapping of Hokkaido or the Japanese Kuriles, Gama or Compagnie remained on maps for about 50 years following Bering's voyages until the explorations of Cook confirmed the Bering findings.   South of the equator the shores of Australia or New Holland are speculatively mapped with a dotted line defining the southern edge of the continent. Van Diemen's Land or Tasmania is depicted attached to the mainland.   Polynesia is mapped with numerous islands named, but few are the correct size or in the correct place.  Hawaii, which had not yet been discovered by Cook, is entirely absent.  What is shown is Terre de Davis roughly where Easter Island is today.  Terre de Davis or Davis' Land was supposedly discovered in  1688 by an English navigator of the same name.  Many historians argue whether or not Davis Land was actually Eastern Island, but it does seem likely.   In South America many of the speculative geographic elements common to earlier maps of the regions, such as El Dorado and Lake Parima, are absent though the Lago de Xarayes does remain. The Xarayes, a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River, were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies. The Laguna de los Xarayes almost immediately began to appear on early maps of the region and, at the same time, took on a legendary aspect as the gateway to the Amazon and the kingdom of El Dorado.   Africa, as usual, is mapped accurately along the coasts and speculatively in the interior.  While numerous tribes, kingdoms, and desert caravan routes are noted, most of the interior is conjectural.  The Nile follows the two lake pattern developed in the 15th century on Ptolemaic maps.  The gold mining region near the Kingdom of Monomotapa are labeled.  South Africa is noted as the home of the Cafrerie and Hottentots.   The great southern content, a kind of speculative proto-Antarctica common to many early maps, is entirely absent, though several Antarctic islands, including the Cap de la Circoncision (Bouvet's Island) and Lozier's B. de L'Oiseau are noted.  Both hemispheres are crowned with an elaborate decorative cartouche in the late baroque style.

Covers the continent from Panama to the arctic circle, extends westward to include parts of Asia and eastward as far as Iceland.  This map, which is heavily influenced by the theoretical mappings of Guillaume de l'Isle and Philippe Buache, went through several states of which this is the first and possibly the most interesting.  Javier divides the continent according to the three colonial powers that controlled it, with England controlling the colonies along the east coast, France occupying Canada and Louisiana, and Spain dominating  Mexico, Florida, Cuba and Central America.   By  far the most interesting aspects of this map deal with Janvier's treatment of the largely unexplored Pacific Northwest.  A magnificent sea, called the Sea of the West or in this case the Baye de L'Ouest, occupies the greater part of the northwestern part of the continent.  This body of water, alternatively called the Sea of the West or Mer de l'Ouest, was speculated by Philippe Buache and Guillaume De l'Isle in the early 18th century based upon wishful thinking, American Indian stories, and the somewhat questionable 16th century explorations of Juan de Fuca.  Janvier gives the Mer de l'Ouest its fullest expression, though he specifically does not connect it to either the network of lakes and rivers extending westward form the Hudson Bay or to the similar network extending westward from Lake Superior.   These river and lake networks were being actively explored throughout the early 18th century by a number of  little known but important French explorers.  Most specifically the explorations of Verenrye with regard to the discovery of the Lake of the Woods (L. Des Bois) and Lake Winnipeg (L. Ouinipigon), both of which appear on this map.   Further north we can find traces of Admiral de Fonte's apocryphal  discovery of a passage from the Pacific (starting at the Archipel St. Lazare) eastward via a network of lakes and rivers to Baffin Bay.  The De Fonte legend first appeared in a 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”. This short-lived magazine published a previously unknown account by a supposed Spanish Admiral named Bartholomew de Fonte. De Fonte is said to have sailed up the Pacific coast of North America in 1640. On this voyage he apparently discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward from the Pacific towards Hudson Bay. The De Fonte story relates how, on one of these great inland lakes, he met with a westward bound ship from Boston that must to have come through the Northwest Passage. Today, based upon inaccuracies and falsities, we know the entire De Fonte article to have been a fabrication, however, it set 18th century afire with speculation that a Northwest Passage must indeed exist. Even such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin wrote long defenses of De Fonte. Our map offers an uncommon variant on the De Fonte passage, positioning its western entrada well to the north in order to accommodate the Sea of the West and situating its outlet at the Baffin rather than the Hudson Bay.   Even farther to the north we find the Strait of Ainan narrowly separating American from Asia.  The extreme northeast tip of Asia  is itself fairly well mapped giving evidence to the explorations of Vitus Bering and Tschirikow.   Slightly to the south of Asia the cartography is slightly less certain with regard to a questionable landmass in the north Pacific.  This mass most likely stems from Tschirikow sightings of the Aleutian Islands and the assumption that they may have been joined.   On the opposite side of the map, Janvier places the Great Lakes firmly within French territory, a clear case of carto-advocacy.  The English colonies, outlined in red are only vaguely accurate with regard to their borders with Pennsylvania and New Jersey extending north to the Canadian border.",1762 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/janvier.txt,"Lattre, Jean, <i>Atlas Moderne ou Collection de Cartes sur Toutes les Parties du Globe Terrestre</i>, c. 1775.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NorthAmerica-janvier-1762.jpg,NorthAmerica-janvier-1762,18,12.5

Even more so, given its directional orientation, it bears a significant resemblance to Gamaland or Companie Land as imagined by Sanson c. 1705.  A not at the very edge of this land mass claims that it was seen in 1741, suggesting either Vitus Bering or Alexei Chirikov.

Covers much of what is today northeastern Canada from Lake Winnipeg to Greenland including all of Hudson Bay.    This region was a hotbed of exploration throughout the 18th century.  French and English concerns in the New World were desperate for access to the Pacific and the rich Asian markets.  These markets had long been dominated by the Spanish who had easy access to the Pacific via Mexico and South America.    The French and English set their hopes on a Northwest Passage.  By the late 18th century the search for a route through the high Arctic had long been abandoned.  Instead, explorers and  theoretical cartographers believed that a water route might be found among the elaborate network of lakes and rivers that meandered through central Canada.  Our map shows evidence of some of this exploration, particularly the travels of the Quebec born Pierre de La Verendrye and his sons around Lake Nipigon (Lac Alimipigon), the Lake of the Woods (Lac des Bois), and Lake Winnipeg (Lac Ouinipigon and Lac Bourbon).   The British were equally active further north.  A  red dotted line encircles the Hudson Bay indicating the lands claimed by the Hudson Bay Company.   In the southern part of Baffin Bay there is a note  in French reading (in transliteration) that the English search for a passage here.  This refers to the De Fonte legend of a northwest passage.   De Fonte was a 17th century Spanish navigator who, the tale goes, discovered a Northwest Passage by sailing up the Pacific Coast.   Originally navigators sought the eastern entrada into the De Fonte channels in the Hudson Bay, but failing to find it, moved their searches further north  into Baffin Bay - as hinted here.  Bonne never gave the De Fonte legend significant credence though he clearly felt compelled to at least mention it on this map.   Our map additionally names various American Indian nations throughout as well as French and English forts throughout.  There are also a number of notations regarding various explorations in  the Hudson Bay, the Arctic, and on land.

A Map of the Islands of Ferro or Farro according to Jacobson Debes.  A Draught of the Whirlpool on the South East of Sumbo Rocks w.th the Soundings. An Improved Map of Iceland","A singularly fascinating 1747 map of Greenland, Iceland and  the Faroe Islands by E. Bowen.    Essentially four maps on one sheet, this map of the North Atlantic islands is festooned with speculation and curiosities.    The uppermost map  is based on reports by the priest Hans Egede and shows the southern portions of Greenland as well as parts of Iceland and James Island.    When this map was drawn the coasts of Greenland were fairly well mapped out by Icelandic and Scandinavian whalers, but the interior was largely unknown.   There was some speculation in the early 17th and 18th centuries that a water passage existed through Greenland providing easy access to Iceland from the Davis Straights.  Our map notes the passage but also comments that it is now impassable due to ice.  Bowen also notes that the seas on either side of the Island are treacherous due to mountains of Ice.  The lower left map depicts the Faroe Islands.  Today these stunning green islands are considered one of the most beautiful and unspoiled places on earth.  Our map depicts the Faroe Islands according a map contained in a 17th century book on the islands written by Jacobson Debes.   The Faroe Islands have been historically treacherous for mariners due to the unpredictable currents and tides surrounding them.  One of the most curious and legendary results of these currents is the great maelstrom that once roared at the southern tip of Sunderoe (today Suouroy Island) - depicted on our map at the right center.    This mighty whirlpool swirled around a sheer pinnacle of rock called Monek, which was said to resemble a monk from one side and a sailing ship from the other.    Reports say that the whirlpool was over a mile in diameter.  Soundings show that the waters surrounding the whirlpool had a depth of some 80 to 90 fathoms, but that the waters nearer the rock, at the center of the maelstrom, were but 7 to 10 fathoms deep.  Sadly this startling natural phenomenon is no more.  In 1884 much of Monek Rock crumbled into the sea, creating a dangerous underwater reef and displacing the unique convergence that created the maelstrom.   In the lower right hand corner of our chart is a map of Iceland.  Iceland had been fairly well mapped since the  late 16th century.  This map, updated from earlier maps, shows the royal residence and four primary provinces.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/America-bowen-1747,Antique Map: 1747 Bowen Map of North America and South America ( Western Hemisphere),A New General Map of America Drawn from several Accurate particular Maps and Charts and Regulated by Astronomical Observations.,"A stunning 1747 decorative map of the Western Hemisphere by E. Bowen.  Covers North and South America as well as much of the Pacific and the Atlantic as far as Spain and the Canary Islands.   Details America during the Colonial Period.   In North America, England controls the colonies along the eastern coast of the continent and surrounding the Hudson Bay.  France occupies Louisiana, parts of Canada, and the Great Lakes region.  Spain controls the western part of the continent as well as Florida, Mexico, most of the West Indies and, with the exception of Portuguese Brazil, all of South America.  Most of western North America is unexplored though Bowen does name several known points along the coast, including the Bay of the Conception and Cape Mendocino.  He also notes Drakes Port where Francis Drake laid claim to New Albion for England in 1579. Though the true location of Drakes Port is the object of considerable debate, most associate it with Pelican Bay on the border of California and Oregon. The Pelican was Francis Drake's ship and the bay is named after it to this day.  Further north the coastline becomes speculative, though the Supposed Straits of Annian are noted.   The Straits of Anian are said to be the entrance to a Northwest Passage discovered in the 16th century by the apocryphal navigator Admiral de Fonte.  Inland, near the northern tip of Baja, Bowen draws Great Teguayo,  one of the Kingdoms of Gold presumed to be found in the unexplored American west.  Teguayo first appears in the  Benevides Memorial , where it is described as a kingdom of great wealth to rival Quivara, another mythical kingdom which curiously does not appear on this map.  The idea was later popularized in Europe by the nefarious Spaniard and deposed governor of New Mexico, the Count of Penalosa. Originally Teguayo was said to lie west of the Mississippi and north of the Gulf of Mexico, but for some reason, Bowen situates it further to the west.  In the same part of the world, Bowen also maps the Rio Grande, or the North River, as a rival in magnificence to the Mississippi itself, extending north well into Canada.  North of Lake Superior Bowen adds another enormous lake, easily rivaling the Great Lakes themselves in its majesty.  Though labeled Assempolis Lake, it most likely represents the Lake of the Woods.  This area was being actively explored in the early 18th century by French traders with hopes of discovering a river route to the Pacific.  Though no such route was ever found, many believed that rivers leading west from the Lake of the Woods would empty into the Pacific or even a great inland sea called the Sea of the West.  Bowen clearly a cautious cartographer, does not speculate on the unknown.  South America is well mapped with numerous Amazon tributaries noted.  Bowen includes the apocryphal Lake of Xarayes as the northern terminus of the Paraguay River.  Xarayes is a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River. The Xaraiés were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies. The Laguna de los Xarayes almost immediately began to appear on early maps of the region and, at the same time, almost immediately took on a legendary aspect as the gateway to El Dorado.   The South Pacific portions of this map contain numerous islands, some of which are real, but most of which are difficult to associate with any actual islands.  The Solomon Islands are drawn wildly out of proportion to their actual size leading to speculation that they may have been confused with nearby New Britain.",1747 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/bowen.txt,"Bowen, E., <i>A complete system of geography.

Covers from Africa and the Mediterranean east to Bering Strait (Detroit du Norte ou d'Anian) and south as far as Java and New Guinea.  This map is most interesting in its rendering of the largely unexplored extreme northwest of Asia.  Yeco or Hokkaido is mapped only speculatively with its western borders unknown.  Shows Sakhalin Island in an embryonic state.  Just to the east of Yeco (Hokkaido), Janvier maps the apocryphal Terre de Gama or Terre de la Company. Often called de Gamma Land or Gama, these islands were supposedly discovered in the 17th century by a mysterious figure known as Jean de Gama. Various subsequent navigators claim to have seen this land, but it was left to Bering to finally debunk the myth. In 1729, he sailed for three days looking for Juan de Gama land but never found it. Thought it may be little more than a mis-mapping of Hokkaido or the Japanese Kuriles, Gama or Compagnie remained on maps for about 50 years following Bering's voyages until the explorations of Cook confirmed the Bering findings.  Though the mainland of Siberia and northeast Asia are remarkably well mapped based upon the explorations of Vitus Bering and Tschirikow, a further anomaly appears in the form of an unusual landmass just to the east of Kamchatka roughly where the Aleutian Islands are today.   A note reads that this land mass claims that it was seen in 1741, suggesting either Vitus Bering or Alexei Chirikov.  This is most likely an embryonic representation of the Muller Peninsula.  The Muller Peninsula was a postulated by Gerhard Muller around this time based on recorded sightings of the Aleutian Archipelago and their misinterpretation of it as a single land mass.   Further to the south New Guinea (Novelle Guinee) is maps speculatively with most of its eastern and southern borders left either blank or hidden behind the grand title cartouche.  A decorative title cartouche displaying the riches of the continent appears in the lower right hand quadrant.  A fine map of the region. Drawn by J.

Roughly covers the territory current incorporated into Mozambique and Madagascar.  Also includes inset map of the Isle Bourbon and Isle de France or Mauritius.     This region of Africa held a particular fascination for Europeans since the Portuguese first encountered it in the 16th century.  At the time,  this area was a vast empire called Mutapa or Monomotapa that maintained an active trading network with faraway partners in India and Asia.   As the Portuguese presence in the area increased in the 17th century, the Europeans began to note that Monomatapa was particularly rich in gold.  They were also impressed with the numerous well crafted stone structures, including the mysterious nearby ruins of Great Zimbabwe.  This combination led many Europeans to believe that King Solomon's mines must be hidden in this region.  Sure enough our map shows the Mts. Fuca riches en Or in the western parts of Monomotapa. Monomotapa did in fact have rich gold mines in the 16th and 17th centuries, but most have these had been exhausted by the 1700s.

Sanson Geographe Ordinaire du Roy 1691.","An extraordinary map of monumental proportions, this Sanson and Jaillot's 1691 decorative map of the world on a double hemisphere projection.  This is the first state of the fourth plate of this map. Covers the entire world according to its 17th century conception. Elaborate allegorical cartouches appear at top center and bottom center detailing cherubs riding dolphins - the symbols of the Dauphin of France.  This map is magnificently colored with extensive gold foiling used throughout both as accent elements and to denote cities.  This type of elaborate colorization theme is highly unusual as gold foil gilting and color work of this caliber was generally only applied to maps that were commissioned for royalty or the high nobility.  The is the only example of this map with such colorization we have ever seen.  Our survey of this map will begin  in North America where California is depicted as an island.  The idea of an insular California first appeared as a work of fiction in Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo's c. 1510 romance  Las Sergas de Esplandian , where he writes  Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons. Baja California was subsequently discovered in 1533 by Fortun Ximenez, who had been sent to the area by Hernan Cortes.  When Cortez himself traveled to Baja, he must have had Montalvo's novel in mind, for he immediately claimed the Island of California for the King.  By the late 16th and early 17th century ample evidence had been amassed, by explorations of the region by Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcon and others, that California was in fact a Peninsula and not and island.  However, by this time other factors were in play.  Francis Drake had sailed north and claimed New Albion near modern day Washington or Vancouver for England.  The Spanish thus needed to promote Cortes' claim on the Island of California to preempt English claims on the western coast  of North America.  The significant influence of the Spanish crown on European cartographers caused a major resurgence of the Insular California theory, of which Sanson was a primary proponent, in the mid to late 17th century.  Shortly after this map was made Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, traveled overland from Mexico to California, proving conclusively the peninsularity of California.   Traveling northwest, away from the mainland, we come across a land labeled Terre de Jesso or  Je Co. or Terre de la Compagnie.  Though Yesso or Jesso is a name usually associated with Hokkaido (which here is drawn as part of mainland Asia), this land mass is more commonly called Gama or Gamaland.  Gama was supposedly discovered in the 17th century by a mysterious figure known as Jean de Gama. Various subsequent navigators claim to have seen this land and it appeared in  numerous maps well into the late 18th century.   At times it was associated with Hokkaido, in Japan, and at other times with the mainland of North America.  On this map we are struck by its uncanny resemblance to Gerhard Muller's peninsula which emerged in the late 18th century. Based on numerous sightings but no significant exploration of the Aleutian Islands, Muller postulated that the archipelago was in fact a single land mass.  This he mapped extending from the North American mainland towards Asia much as the Terre de Compagnie does on this map.  It is not inconceivable that navigators sailing in the northern seas from Asia could have made this same error in the 16th and 17th centuries.   Moving east of California into the North American mainland we find ourselves in the Spanish colony of New Mexico.",1691 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sanson.txt,"Jaillot, H., <i>Atlas Nouveau</i>, 1691 edition.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/World-sanson-1691.jpg,World-sanson-1691,35.5,22

Based on earlier Homann maps and research by Anville, this map covers the northwestern part of Africa from Cape Blanc and Senegal to Guinea Inferior, around the Bite of Africa, to the Congo and Barbela Rivers. As with most maps of Africa from this period, the coastlands are highly detailed while the interior is either blank or extremely speculative.  The coastal lands between the Niger River and Biafra are particularly well mapped with copious Latin notations regarding the peoples and places depicted.  The inland course of the Niger River itself, a matter that was being actively debated in Europe at the time, is mostly speculative beyond a certain point.  Our map actually shows two Niger Rivers, an eastern and western Niger, which are proximal to one another but do not in fact meet up.  There are several unnamed mountain ranges in the interior which are possibly an embryonic representation of the Mountains of Kong - a presumed source of the Niger that was popularized in the late 18th and early 19th century. This map also names numerous African kingdoms and tribal groups, including Biafra, Benin, Bambara, Pongo, Bituin, etc.  One of the most outstanding aspects of this map is the spectacular decorative cartouche in the lower left quadrant.  Ostensibly the cartouche depicts a typical African village.  Shows several huts as well as indigenous Africans engaged in various  tribal activities.   Each element of the cartouche is labeled with a letter and referenced in a table below the map.    On a deeper level the cartouche is designed to highlight the lucrative ivory trade.  Cherubic African children are depicted playing with monstrous Elephant tusks which are also shown stacked in the background.  In a moment of artistic inspiration, the creator of this cartouche also uses the large ivory tusks in the foreground to show his distance scales.  This map was drawn by Matthias Haas based on the cartographic work of J. B. de Anville.

Covers from Brandenburg to Russia and from the Gulf of Livonia to Moldova and Hungary, including all of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, parts of Prussia, Russia, Livonia, Hungary, Germany and Austria.  This map depicts Poland in 1794, immediately following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793.   By the mid 18th century Poland, due to an inefficient and corrupt internal bureaucracy, had lost much of its autonomy to its aggressive and powerful neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia. The First Partition occurred in 1772 with Prussia occupying Poland's long coveted western territories, Austria seizing Galicia, and Russia taking part of Livonia. In the aftermath of the First Partition, the Second Partition was almost inevitable.  Poland allied with Prussia to thwart the ambitions of Russia in the East.  This, along with a number of other factors, lead to the War in Defense of the Constitution between Poland and Russia. Largely abandoned by their Prussian allies, Poland could not hope to stand against the powerful Russian military.   Poland's defeat resulted in the loss of nearly 50% of its remaining territory to Russia and Prussia, who signed an accord in 1793.  One year after this map was made, in 1795, the Third Partition of Poland would dissolve what remained of the reduced Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, ending Polish all autonomy in the 18th century.

This extraordinary map is so large and so rich in detail that it is exceptionally challenging to do it full justice in either photographic or textual descriptions.  Covers the entire world in a double hemisphere projection. The primary  map is surrounded on all sides but detailed scientific calculations and descriptions as well as northern and southern hemisphere star charts, a map of the Moon, a Latitude and Longitude Analemma chart, a map of the Solar System, a Mercator projection of the world, an Analemma projection, a seasonal  chart, a universal scale chart, and numerous smaller diagrams depicting planets and mathematical  systems. All text is in English.  We will start our survey of this map in North America, much of which was, even in 1794, largely unknown.  This  map follows shortly after the explorations of Captain Cook in the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, so the general outline of the continent is known. However, when this map was made, few inland expeditions had extended westward beyond the Mississippi.  This map notes two separate speculative courses for the apocryphal River of the West, a northern route extending from Lake Winnipeg and a southern route passing south of Winnepeg through Pike's lake.  The River of the West was hopeful dream of French and English explorers who were searching for a water passage through North America to the Pacific.  In concept, should such a route be found, it would have become an important trade artery allowing the British and French, who's colonies dominated the eastern parts of North America, to compete with the Spanish for control of the lucrative Asia-Pacific trade.  Little did these earlier speculative cartographers realize the bulk of the Rocky Mountains stood between them and their dreams!  Slightly south of the Rivers of the West, we find the kingdom of Quivira, which is one of the lands associated with Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold.  In this area we can also find Drake's Harbor or Port de la Bodega and Albion.  Drake's Harbor is where Sir Francis Drake supposedly landed during his circumnavigation of  the globe in 1580.  Drake wintered in this harbor and used the abundant resources of the region to repair his ships.  He also claimed the lands for England dubbing them New Albion.  Although the true location of Drake's port is unknown, most place it much further to the north.  By situating it and consequently New Albion further to the south, Dunn is advocating a British rather than Spanish claim to this region.   On the Eastern coast of North America we find a fledgling United States extending from Georgia to Maine.   Dunn names Boston, New York, Charleston, Long Island, and Philadelphia, as well as the important smaller towns of Jamestown, Williamsburg and Edonton.   South America exhibits a typically accurate coastline and limited knowledge of the interior beyond Peru and the populated coastlands.  A few islands are noted off the coast, including the Galapagos, which are referred to as the Inchanted Islands. The Amazon is vague with many of its tributaries drawn in speculatively.  Dunn and d'Anville have done away with the popular representation of Manoa or El Dorado in Guyana, but a vestigial Lake Parima is evident.  Further south, the Laguna de los Xarayes, another apocryphal destination, is drawn at the northernmost terminus of the Paraguay River. The Xaraiés, meaning Masters of the River were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies.",1794 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/dunn.txt,"Kitchin, Thomas, <i>Kitchin's General Atlas, describing the Whole Universe: being a complete collection of the most approved maps extant; corrected with the greatest care, and augmented from the last edition of D'Anville and Robert with many improvements by other eminent geographers, engraved on Sixty-Two plates, comprising Thirty Seven maps.</i>, Laurie & Whittle, London, 1797.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/World2-dunn-1794.jpg,World2-dunn-1794,49,42

Pownall, Membr. of Parlimt.","An extraordinary monumentally proportioned 1794 map of North American by Governor Pownell.  Issued shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War, this map details the newly formed United States, the British dominions in Canada, the French territory of Louisiana, the West Indies, and Spanish holdings in Mexico, Florida, and Central America.  As one might expect from a map of this size the detail throughout is extraordinary.  All text is in English.   We begin our examination of this map in the newly formed post colonial United States.  The United States at this time extended from the Pacific to the Mississippi River and from Georgia to the Great Lakes and Maine.  The early state boundaries roughly conform to their original colonial charters.  Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina are drawn with indefinite western borders, suggesting claims to further unexplored land beyond the Appellation Mountains.  By this time most of the boundary issues in the New England states had been resolved,  though there remained some vagaries regarding the Massachusetts Connecticut border and, though Vermont is noted textually, its boundaries are not drawn in.  At this time there were also some unresolved issues  regarding the national borders between Maine and Nova Scotia.   In Pennsylvania, the western border displays some surveying confusions that would not be resolved until the early 1800s and the creation of Ohio.   It is beyond the old colonial centers where this map really gets interesting.  Pownall offers copious notations on the lands and territories between the Appellation range and this Mississippi River.  In some cases he offers commentary on the various indigenous tribes including the Creeks, Chickasaws, Chocktaws, Senekas, Eriez, Delawares, Shawnee, Iroquois, Algonquians, Ottawas and others.  The cartographer was clearly concerned with the development of these western regions and offers copious commentary on fit sites for factories, the alliances and temperaments of tribes, and the navigability of various river systems, particularly the Mississippi and Ohio.    The Great Lakes are mapped with considerable accuracy though several apocryphal islands do appear in Lake Superior.  The most  notable of these are Phelipeaux and Pontchartrain.  Phelipeaux Island first appeared in French maps of this region in the 1740s.  Later it was mentioned as a boundary marker in the 1783 Treaty of Paris which ended the American Revolutionary War.  The nonexistence of these islands was not conclusively proven until about 1820.   To the west of the Mississippi we pass into the largely unknown lands of the Great Plains.   In what is roughly modern day Missouri, between Memphis and St. Louis, there is an interesting note suggesting that this region is Full of Mines, with a secondary note suggesting that these mines gave rise to the Mississippi Scheme of 1719. This refers to the Mississippi Company ( Compagnie du Mississippi ) or, as it was more commonly known the Indies Company ( Compagnie d'Occident ).  This organization was part of a French investment plan comparable to the South Seas Company which was developing contemporaneously in England.  The Mississippi Company's charter was to trade the riches of the Louisiana Territory.  The main proponent of the Mississippi Company, John Law, greatly exaggerated the wealth of Louisiana by describing a rich mining region easily accessible along the Mississippi from New Orleans.   This resulted in a stock buying rush which  disproportionately overvalued Mississippi Company stock, resulting in one of the world's first Bubble Economies.    Further North, along the northern border between the United States and British America (Canada), Rain Lake, the Lake of the Woods, and Lake Winnepeg are noted.  This region was a hotbed of exploration throughout the 18th century.",1794 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/pownall.txt,"Kitchin, Thomas, <i>Kitchin's General Atlas, describing the Whole Universe: being a complete collection of the most approved maps extant; corrected with the greatest care, and augmented from the last edition of D'Anville and Robert with many improvements by other eminent geographers, engraved on Sixty-Two plates, comprising Thirty Seven maps.</i>, Laurie & Whittle, London, 1797.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NorthAmerica-pownall-1794.jpg,NorthAmerica-pownall-1794,46,40

Improved and Inlarged form D’Anville’s Map to which has been added A Particular Chart of the Gold Coast wherein are Distinguished all the European Forts, and Factories by S. Boulton and also A Summary Description relative to the Trade adn Natural Produce, Manners and Customs of the African Continent and Islands.","This is probably the most important map of Africa produced in the 18th century.  Largely based upon the earlier D’Anville map, this map has been enlarged and expanded by Samuel Boulton.  Depicts the continent in full with insets of the Gold Coast (or Ivory Coast, or Guinea). This map is unique in that it is a serious attempt to compile all of the accurate scientific knowledge of the African continent available at the time. In contrast to many other Africa maps of the period there almost no attempt to fill the “unknown” regions of the interior with fictitious beasts, kingdoms, and geological features. Boulton himself advertises “The inland parts of Africa being but very little known and the names of the regions and countries which fill that vast tract of land being for the greatest part placed by conjecture it may be judged how absurd are the divisions traced in some maps and why they are not followed in this. Despite this, this map actually does provide a wealth of information both in the form of a gazetteer printed in framed text boxes here and there on the map, as well as political and geographical features.  This map bears up to almost endless perusal and volumes could be composed on its content. The cartographer attempts to depict both known and unknown parts of the continent with actual data reported by both contemporary and ancient travelers.  In most cases it is extremely difficult to identify specific sources as much of the data is vague and uncertain.  Boulton for example  notes a community of Jews near what would today be Mali.  Though a very small community of Jewish traders did live in Mali in the 15th century, most had been killed or converted to Islam by the 16th century.   No doubt Boulton's sources here were extremely archaic.   Boulton also relies heavily on the geography of Claudius Ptolemy, noting this source in numerous notations which range from commentary on local peoples  to the courses of important river systems.  Clearly much of the map is focused on commerce and where information is available, Boulton makes notes on local commercial products and mineral wealth.   There are also copious notations on caravan routes, especially those routes which were known to offer caravan transverse of the Sahara.    Generally following Ptolemy, Boulton includes a number of mysterious river systems which seem to appear out of nowhere and run to nowhere.  With regard to the White Nile, which he presumes correctly to be greater than the Blue Nile, he follows the ancient two lakes at the base of the Mountains of the Moon theory.    In the southern half of Africa there is considerably less information on the interior save for those lands mapped by the Portuguese along the Congo and Zambezi Rivers.   The regions around the Zambezi, called Monomotapa, are particularly interesting  as many considered this area to be the Biblical land of Ophir, where one could discover the mines of King Solomon.   Just north of Monomotapa we find an embryonic representation of Lake Malawi, here called Maravi.  In South Africa the Dutch Company is strongly established and the region is well mapped well into the interior.

This remarkable map was drawn in 1601 by Theodore de Bry to describe the ill fated third voyage of the Dutch explorer William Barentsz in search of the Northeast Passage.  The map depicts the Island of Nova Zemba, or Novaya Zemlya, in the Russian Arctic along with two stunning compass roses, numerous rhumb lines, and a multitude of seals and sea monsters.  Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries the concept of a Northeast Passage through the Arctic to Asia held the same significance as North America's Northwest Passage.  The nations of Northern Europe, particularly Russia and Holland, were eager to find an easy route to Asia via the Arctic in order to access the lucrative trade with China and India.  Barentsz's first expedition in 1594, in which he discovered Novaya Zemlya and a number of other Arctic Islands, was widely publicized in Europe and led to the assumption that a Northwest Passage may indeed be feasible.  His second voyage, 1595, was considered a truncated failure due to inclement weather and ice packs in the Kara Sea.  A year later, his third voyage in 1596 was a utter disaster.  Our map details Barentsz's route as he passes north of Finland and thus into the Russian Arctic.  His expedition then travels north and northwest along the western shore and ultimately around the northern tip of the archipelago.  Here the ice flows coming out of the high Arctic trapped Barentsz 'sexpedition and ultimately forced them ashore.  Using the timber from their ship they constructed a small cabin where, subsisting on stores from the ship and the occasional polar bear, they survived the unbelievably harsh winter.  By June, the ice still refused to yield up the surviving ship, so the desperate sailors decided to try their luck on two smaller vessels.  These, shown at the extreme right of the map, in seven weeks of harrowing sea travel eventually circumnavigated Nova Zembla and were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel near the Kola Peninsula.  Barentsz himself perished on this desperate trip scarcely seven days after leaving Nova Zembla.    However, some of his companions, on returning Holland, published an account of the voyage for which this map was made.  In 1871, the Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen rediscovered Barentsz' cabin on Nova Zembla - perfectly preserved due to the Arctic cold.  Today icebreakers filled with tourists stop at the site as they round Nova Zembla.  On a darker note, Nova Zembla, or more appropriately in this case Novaya Zemlya, was also the site of Russian nuclear testing during the Cold War.  The world's largest above ground nuclear detonation, the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba, exploded here n 1961.

This is an extremely rare variant on the map of Central Park that originally appeared in the 1864  Commissioner's Report . This variant lacks the decorative border and hand coloring but makes certain additions, such as profiles of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other Central Park buildings.  Also features an index in the Old Croton Reservoir. Depicts the park as a whole and includes pathways, lakes, buildings, individual trees, rocks, and elevation measurements.   This extraordinary map reveals Central Park as conceived by the Landscape Architects, and indeed “artists”, Vaux and Olmstead. Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council. Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park. The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design. The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned. Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Historian Gloria Deak writes, There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’ Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privilege of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban public recreation area in the world.",1893 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sarony.txt,"Smith, William F., <i>Illustrated and Historical Souvenir of Central Park  New York</i>, 1893.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CentralPark-smith-1893.jpg,CentralPark-smith-1893,35,9

Depicts North America, Central America and South America as well as parts of Polynesia, Siberia, Greenland, Iceland, Europe and Africa.  The routes of various important explores are noted, including Cook, Vancouver, Perouse, and the return route of the Resolution.  In North America, thanks primarily to the work of Cook in the Pacific Northwest the coasts are rendered with considerable accuracy.  The interior of North America, particularly the American West, is still rather vague, though much of the cartography is clearly derived from Humboldt's explorations.  Notes the apocryphal River Buenaventura as well as a conjectural placement of the western extreme of the Missouri River.  The United States, still quite small, does not yet include Florida, Louisiana, California or Texas.    South America exhibits its typical clear outline and speculative interior.  Pinkerton resurrects the idea of Lake Parima in Guyana - supposed site of El Dorado - which had all but disappeared from most other early 19th century.  He has however, dropped the Apocryphal Laguna de Xarayes, commonly located at the northern extremis of the Paraguay or Parma River.   However, he does note several supposed gold mines deep in the Amazon, which may or may not reflect indigenous legends of El Dorado.      Drawn by L.

The routes of various important explores are noted, including Cook, Vancouver, Perouse, and the return route taken by Cook's ship, the Resolution, following his death in Hawaii.  This map offers fairly accurate shorelines throughout.  In Africa, the interior remains unexplored except for the Congo, the Cape Colony, the gold mining regions of Monomotapa, and Abyssinia.

On a Polar projection, this map depicts North America, Asia, the East Indies, and North Africa.    In North America, thanks primarily to the work of Cook in the Pacific Northwest, the coasts are rendered with considerable accuracy.  The interior of North America, particularly the American West, is still rather vague, though much of the cartography is clearly derived from the exploration of Humboldt and the Louis and Clark expedition.  Notes the apocryphal River Buenaventura as well as a conjectural placement of the western extreme of the Missouri River.  The United States, still quite small, does not yet include Florida, Louisiana, California or Texas.   Asia is drawn with considerable accuracy thanks to Russian and Chinese cartographers, however, there remain some unexplored areas in Central Asia.    Africa is well mapped along the coast, but  much of the interior is speculative.  Shows the mythical Mountains of Kong (supposed southern boundary of the Niger River) meeting the equally mythical Mountains of  the Moon (Supposed Source of the White Nile).  Pinkerton positions the Mountains of the Moon much farther north than most cartographers and abandons the old Ptolemaic double lake theory.  This is a curious decision that we can only assume is based upon speculation that the Mountains of the Moon are part of the same chain as the Mountains of Kong.    Far to the north, in the high Arctic, there is a partial land mass with the note Coast discovered by the Hunters employed by m. Liakhov.

Gomboust held the position of  Ingenieur du Roi  and, in that capacity completed a number of important survey's of Paris which eventually evolved into this spectacular map.  Oriented to the east, this map covers Paris from the Bastille to the Tuileries Garden and from St. Lazare to the Pont de Fauxbourg de St. Jacques.  This is a geometric delineation of Paris and offers numerous decorative elements, including profile views of all significant Paris buildings.  Views of the city itself decorate the upper right and left quadrants.  The lower right and left quadrants feature dramatic neoclassical pedestals surmounted by baroque armorial crests.

This map is a seminal cartographic masterpiece that bridges the gap between city plans as views and modern maps.  All previous maps of Paris depicted the city as elevated profile views - thus anyone looking at the map might recognize this or that building by is well known appearance from the ground.  While Gomboust retains this feature with regard to Paris' most important structures, for the most part, he creates a modern map, displaying the city as it would appear from directly above.  At the time, this was a very impractical way to depict Paris, for the average person would be incapable of interpreting such a presentation.  In viewing such a map, some scholars argue, the typical Parisian embraces the King's View of the city, and thus embraces his authority.

Covers Africa from Angola south to the Cape Colony (modern South Africa) and east to the Kingdom of Mongall (modern day Mozambique) and the island of Madagascar.  Reflecting the somewhat limited knowledge of the African interior available to European cartographers of the period, only three areas are illustrated with any detail - the Congo, the Cape Colony (South Africa) and the former Kingdom of Monomotapa, which roughly overlaps modern day Mozambique.     The Congo had been actively mapped and exploited by Portuguese merchants as early as the 14th century.  South Africa, similarly, had an active Dutch and English presence since the earliest days of African Colonization.   The ancient Kingdom of Monomotapa, here part of the Empire of the Bororos and divided into Sabia, Sofala, Munhay and Manica, appears on most early maps of Africa.  Already a great trading Empire when Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape of Good hope in the 1490s, Monomotapa or the regions between the Sabia, Sofala and Zambezi River systems, had long been associated with legends of King Solomon's Mines and the Biblical lands of Ophir.  In the 15th century the Zambezi hills were indeed rich in gold, but these deposits had run out by the 1600s.  Still, the European imagination, inflamed by conquistador tales of golden empires in America, made several attempts to conquer the region, only to find that there was no more gold to be had.  In other areas of Africa's interior Pinkerton notes an embryonic Lake Malawi (named Maravi), and notes several important African tribal nations, including the Massai, the Hottentots, the Bembe, and the Luba (Lubolo).

Produced by John Pinkerton and based largely on the explorations of Alexander von Humboldt, this map Covers from the San Francisco Bay to the Mississippi Delta and from Lake Timpanagos (Great Salt Lake area) to Veracruz and Guadalajara.  Though ostensibly similar to John Thompson's map of the same region, Pinkerton's map in fact a far different and vastly superior map.  The entire map is flush with a level of detail that is nothing short of astounding.  Pinkerton utilizes a cleaver engraving technique to represent the vast plains west of the Mississippi.  Numerous important Spanish colonial cities and missions are named, including Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and the city of Pres del Bejar, Capital of the Province of Texas.  New Mexico is reduced form a formerly vast territory to a relatively narrow strip of land attached to the Rio Norte (now the Colorado River).  Much of modern day Texas is part of the Intendancy of San Louis de Potosi.  Shows both Lake Timpanagos (Great Salt Lake) and Lake Teguayo (Utah Lake) with some accuracy regarding form.  The apocryphal River Buenaventura flows eastward from Utah lake into the Rocky Mountains.  In the Great Plains, Pinkerton provides a unusual wealth of detail, some drawn from preliminary accounts of Lewis and Clark, but most derived from other sources. Many of the great rivers systems are shown in considerable detail including notations on portages and navigability.  Identifies the hunting grounds of numerous American Indian tribes, including the Apache, Acoma, Pawnee, Delaware, Juma, Comanche, and others.  Along the west coast numerous missions are noted including the Mission of San Francisco, the Mission of San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Buenaventura, etc.  All in all a remarkable map and a must for any serious collection focused on the American Southwest.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Caracas-pinkerton-1818,"Antique Map: 1818 Pinkerton Map of Northeastern South America (Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam)",The Caracas.,"This is a stunning, highly detailed, and extremely interesting map of northeastern South America.  Covers the modern day countries of Venezuela, British Guyana, French Guyana, Surinam and parts of Brazil.  Pinkerton offers impressive detail throughout noting indigenous groups, missions, towns and cities, swamps, mountains, and river systems. Upper right hand quadrant features the title plate and two distance scales, one in British Miles and the other in Spanish Leagues.   Cartographically speaking this is an often neglected part of the world - especially in the early 19th century.  Though the coastlands had been well mapped early in the 16th century, the interior was rarely penetrated.  The combination of mountainous terrain, daunting jungles, malaria, and unfriendly indigenous groups combine to make this area all but unexplorable - even today.  Nonetheless, Pinkerton make a commendable attempt to piece together early conquistador accounts, explorer's journals, missionary records, and indigenous reports into a coherent mapping of the area.   Probably the most interesting aspect of this map is Pinkerton's treatment of the apocryphal Lake Parima.  Lake Parima was first identified by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century - though he admittedly never saw the lake himself.  Raleigh associated the lake with indigenous legends of Manoa and the supposed site of El Dorado.  Many early maps actually show El Dorado on the shores of Lake Parima, though Pinkerton curiously does not.  However, his rendition of Lake Parima is vastly larger than most previous examples from the late 18th century - even those by other English cartographers such as Laurie and Whittle.  The reality of Lake Parima and the Manoa is based upon Raleigh's misinterpretation of local trade networks.  The Manoas were a river trading tribe based in the Amazon.   Each year during the rainy season flooding on the Orinoco and Parima rivers would create a large flood plain and open channels of trade between the  two otherwise unconnected regions.  Raleigh misinterpreted these watery trade channels as a great lake.  This map's curious elements, however, do not end with Lake Parima.  Pinkerton makes several bold attempts to map the various unexplored river systems of the region.  He offers duly noted speculative courses for the Orinoco, the Maroni and the Rio Negro, among others.  He also notes the sites of various battles and the bases of rebels and escaped slaves.

Nonetheless, Pinkerton make a commendable attempt to piece together early conquistador accounts, explorer's journals, missionary records, and indigenous reports into a coherent mapping of the area.   By far the most interesting aspect of Pinkerton's work in this region is his ethnographic commentary on the various indigenous tribes.  He identifies the Gaberres inventors of curare, the most active poison hithero known,  the Encabellados or hairy nation, and the Chiricoas a small wandering nation,  among others.  He also names the sites of various Spanish towns and missions along the numerous inland rivers systems that spring from the Amazon and Orinoco.

In doing so he achieves a number of significant advances in the mapping of the region.  In general, this map reads like a litany of disappointment.  The  number if ruined towns, abandoned missions, forgotten mines, and destroyed settlements would be hard to match in any other map. Pinkerton notes the ruins of La Conception, St. Isabel, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Guadalcazar to name but a few.  In the Andes, he identifies the sites of a number of important mountains and volcanoes including Aconcagua, Coquimbo, Petoroa, and others.  He also identifies the site of the majestic ruined pre-Columbian city on the shores of Lake Titicaca.  Traditionally cartographers identified the apocryphal Lake of Xarayes as the source of the Paraguay River.

Based on Arrowsmith's historic map of North America, this map covers the continent north of the 40th degree of latitude, including all of the territory currently claimed by Canada.  This fascinating map follows roughly 100 years of vigorous exploration of this region by adventurers in search of a navigable river and lake route from the Great Lakes to the Pacific.  And yet, even after all of this exploration, much of the territory remains vague and uncertain.  Details numerous river systems and lakes, some real, some fictional, between the Hudson Bay and the Rocky Mountains.  Offers copious notations throughout, such as great quantities of coal in this creek and Knistineaux war route.  Shows the Missouri River as far as the Mandan settlements where Louis and Clark wintered.  Though the official narrative of Louis and Clark's historic journey had not been published when this map was in production, it is possible that Pinkerton had access to some preliminary accounts.  Names several sightings of the Arctic Sea, far to the north, by the explorers Mackenzie and Hearne in the 18th century.   The west coast, including Vancouver Islands, is particularly well mapped.

Covers from Darfur east to the Gulf of Aden and from Aswan south to Gingiro.  Includes the  modern day countries of Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eretria as well as parts of Djibouti, Kenya, Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.    This  map is centered on the southern reaches of the Nile River.  Shows the division of the Nile in modern day Sudan between the White Nile, which flows slightly westward and the Blue Nile which flows slightly eastward. The Blue Nile had, by this time, been traced to its source, Lake Tana, in the relatively well mapped Christian kingdom of Abyssinia.   The White Nile is shown originating the Mountains of the Moon in the extreme lower left quadrants of this map. The Mountains of the Moon were an apocryphal source for the Nile River speculated upon by as early as Herodotus but more commonly by the second century geographer Claudius Ptolemy.  It is a curious decision on the part of Pinkerton to keep the Mountains of the Moon as a source of the White Nile, but abandon the associated lake theory that, ultimately proved to have some relation to reality.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/jerusalem-fuller-1650,"Antique Map: 1650 Fuller Map of Jerusalem ( Israel, Palestine, Holy Land)",IERUSALEM qualis (ut plurimum) extitit ætate Solomonis,"An extremely rare and altogether fascinating 1650 map of Jerusalem by Thomas Fuller.  Depicts the old walled city of Jerusalem during the reign of the Biblical King Solomon, ca. 961-922 BC.  On the whole this is a highly imaginative map of the city and likely bears no significant resemblance to the Jerusalem of Solomon.  Solomon's Temple appears at the right center with a tall bell tower and a highly Renaissance European design aesthetic. At the center, roughly where the Church of Holy Sepulture is located today, is Solomon's menagerie.  The Baths of Bethesda, in which an angel swims, appear in the upper right, approximately where they are said to be today.   Other sites of note include Domus David near the modern day Jaffa Gate, the armory in the lower left, the Kings House at bottom center, Solomon's throne near the menagerie at center, the golden gate at right center, etc.  Throughout the streets are arranged with an uncanny geometric precisions.   Outside the walls Fuller identifies the Mount of Olives (Montis Oliueti), the Dragon Well, the Fullers Field, the King's Garden, and despite purportedly being a map of Solomon's Jerusalem, the Crucifixion on Calvary.  A armorial crest and a dedication to Eduardo Montagu, or Edward Montagu, the First Earl of Sandwich, appears in the upper right quadrant.  Engraved by John Williams for the 1650 first edition of Thomas Fuller's  A Pisgah-sight of Palestine .

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Mexico-finely-1827,"Antique Map: 1827 Finley Map of Mexico, Upper California and Texas",Mexico.,"A scarce and important 1827 map of Mexico by Anthony Finley.  Covers from upper California and New Albion south to Guatemala, including the modern day regions of California, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Texas and Mexico.  Offers an interesting pre-Republic mapping of Texas folded into the Intendency of San Louis Potosi.  Here New Mexico, previously a vast territory, is limited to a narrow sliver of land attached to the upper Rio Norte or Rio Grande.    Further west this map really gets interesting with the explorations of Escalante and Humboldt very much in evidence.  Finley curiously charts two lakes in the Great Basin, one labeled Timpanagos and another smaller lake further south labeled Salt Lake.  The Great Salt Lake is said to have first been seen by Europeans in 1824, only a few years before this map was published, so it is unlikely that Finley drew from this exploration.  Instead, Finely is following Escalante's discoveries as recorded on the Miera map.  The Escalante expedition actually visited Utah Lake (Timpanagos), but only heard about the Great Salt Lake from local native American Ute tribe.   Miera, Escalante's cartographer, thus mapped Timpanagos as much larger than the unseen Great Salt Lake.     Finley also maps the Buenaventura River running from the Rocky Mountains westward through Salt Lake and westward to San Francisco Bay.  The Buenaventura is the last incarnation of the apocryphal River of the West, a long sought after speculative alternative to the Northwest Passage.  The mapping of Buenaventura here again references legitimate discoveries by Escalante of the White River and the Sevier River.  In this case, both are mistakenly associated with the River of the West and given an erroneous outlet into San Francisco Bay.  In addition to geographical notations, Finley also identifies a number of American Indian nations including the Moqui, Apache, Juma, Nochi, Poagos and Yahipias (with long beards).

The Delaware tribe, which originally occupied the Delaware River valley near Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is here shown in a middling stage in it forced migration westward.  Most of the other tribes noted, including the Miami and Pottawatomie, were inhabitants of this region when the first Europeans arrived.  Within a few short years of this maps construction, most of these tribes were forcibly removed to the Indian Territory or Oklahoma.  This map was updated yearly from 1824 to the mid 1830s.

Title and scale in lower left quadrant.   Finley's map of Mississippi is particularly interesting and important due to its portrayal of the rapidly changing American Indian situation in the northern part of the state.

Within the Indian lands numerous missionary stations are noted, including Elliot, Monroe, and Mayhew.  Also notes the New Choctaw Agency. Just four years after this map was made the Chickasaw and Choctaw would forcibly relocated westward in the infamous Trail of Tears. This map was updated yearly from 1824 to the mid 1830s.  A full series of these maps is a powerful illustration of both the American Indian relocations.  Also of interest are the several roadways that run northwest through the Chickasaw and Choctaw  territories.  These are the Old Natchez Road (also called the Natchez Trace), the Robinson Road, and  Jacksons Road.  The roadways through the Indian territories were mostly traveled by missionaries and a hardy group known as Kaintucks.  Kaintucks were river men who made a living transporting goods down the Mississippi from Ohio and Indiana.  Afterwards they would travel north by land from Jackson to Nashville, where they could once again navigate the rivers back to Ohio.  In the early 19th century over 10,000 Kaintucks a year used these roads.  The Robinson Road was also the primary postal route.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthAmerica-finley-1827,Antique Map: 1827 Finley Map of North America,North America.,"This is Finley’s desirable 1827 map of the North America.  Covers the continent from Panama to the Arctic Circle, including Greenland, Iceland, and the northwestern tip of Asia.  Color coding according to country.  Shows U.S. claims to British Columbia prior to the 1818 compromise that set the boundary at the 49th parallel. Border compromise added by original owner in manuscript annotation.  Also shows Mexico's claims to Upper California, here labeled New Albion and Unexplored Territory.  Finley curiously charts two lakes in the Great Basin, one labeled Timpanagos and another smaller lake further south labeled Salt Lake.  The Great Salt Lake is said to have first been seen by Europeans in 1824, only a few years before this map was published, so it is unlikely that Finley drew from this exploration.  Instead, Finely is following Escalante's discoveries as recorded on the Miera map.  The Escalante expedition actually visited Utah Lake (Timpanagos), but only heard about the Great Salt Lake from local native American Ute tribe.   Miera, Escalante's cartographer, thus mapped Timpanagos as much larger than the unseen Great Salt Lake.     In addition, Finley maps the Buenaventura River running from the Rocky Mountains westward through Salt Lake and westward to San Francisco Bay.  The Buenaventura is the last incarnation of the apocryphal River of the West, a long sought after speculative alternative to the Northwest Passage.  The mapping of Buenaventura here again references legitimate discoveries by Escalante of the White River and the Sevier River.  In this case, both are mistakenly associated with the River of the West and given an erroneous outlet into San Francisco Bay.  There are additional notations  on several Arctic expeditions in northern Canada by Kensir (1789), Hearne (1771) and Franklin (1821).  Each identified a sea between the 60th and 70th parallel.  Though not fuller explored until later, these are most likely the first sightings of Dolphin and Union Strait, Austin Bay, Coronation Gulf and the Dease Strait.  These bodies of water lie between the North American mainland and Victoria Island.   Mile scale and title in the upper right quadrant.

No.,"This is a rare 1748 nautical chart of the Pacific Ocean by George Anson and R. W. Seale. Chart depicts the trade routes used by Spanish Galleons from Acapulco, Mexico heading towards Manila in the Philippines. In particular, this chart depicts the travels of the Spanish Nostra Seigniora de Cabadonga and the British Navy Commodore George Anson.  Anson lead an ill-equipped expedition into the Pacific with the mission to attack Spanish dominions in South America. Though he failed in this mission, Anson did succeed in capturing the Spanish treasure galleon off Cape Espiritu Santo on June 20, 1743. The Spanish galleon was loaded with gold, silver and, more importantly, nautical charts depicting the trade routes used by Spanish Galleons between Mexico and Manila for the previous 200 years. This significant discovery allowed the British to disrupt Spain’s trade in the Pacific and thus economically handicap the Spanish dominance of the New World. Following his capture of the Nostra, its treasures were paraded through the streets of London in no less than 32 wagons. Anson was hailed as a national hero. Beautifully details the Pacific Islands and much of the Mexican and California coast.  Names numerous important destinations along the California coast including Cabo San Lucas, San Diego, and Acapulco.  Rhumb lines throughout.

Largely based upon the earlier D’Anville map, this map has been enlarged and expanded by the English publishing house of Laurie and Whittle.  Depicts the continent in full with an inset of the Falkland Islands. This map is unique in that it is a serious attempt to compile all of the accurate scientific knowledge of the South American continent available at the time.  Offers a smorgasbord of factual, speculative, and historical detail.   This extraordinary and highly decorative map bears up to almost endless perusal and volumes could be composed upon its content. The cartographer attempts to depict both known and unknown parts of the continent with actual data reported by both contemporary and historic travelers.  In most cases it is extremely difficult to identify specific sources as much of the data is vague and uncertain.  Our survey of this map beings with the coast which Spanish and Portuguese navigators had mapped with considerable accuracy as early as the late 16th century. This, like most early maps of the area, contrasts a detailed mapping of the coast with a speculative discussion of the interior, particularly Patagonia and the Amazon Basin. Offers a fairly accurate discussion of both the east and west coasts with exceptional detail in the populated Andean regions of Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador (Labeled Quito), and Peru.  Notes Cuzco, Lima, Quito, Valladolid, Arequipa, Trujillo and other important trading centers of the region. In Portuguese controlled Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, San Salvador and San Sebastian are noted.  It is in the interior that this map becomes exceptionally fascinating.   In the northern part of the  continent D'Anville maps a number of confusions associated with the English adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh's search for El Dorado.  Believing El Dorado to lie in the northern part of the Amazon, Raleigh sailed down the Orinoco River just before the onset of the rainy season.  Reaching a remote tribal  village, Raleigh noted canoes arriving bearing gold, silver, and other treasures. Asked where the gold came from, the natives replied, Manoa, the term for the tribe to which the river traders belonged.  Manoa, the natives claimed could be reached following a long river voyage southward to a Great Lake, called Parima.  Raleigh and his associates immediately associated Manoa and Lake Parima with the golden kingdom of El Dorado, though they never visited the city or lake.  Subsequent maps, including this one, mapped El  Dorado and Lake Parima in this location for several hundred years.  Both Raleigh and the natives were describing an actual event known to occur annually in the region.  Rains would annually swell the Amazon and Orinoco river systems creating a linkage in the Parima flood plain, which, during heavy rains, can resemble a massive lake.  The Manoa were a large and populous trading nation active pre-colonial days whose vast empire, based in the Amazon Basin, extended form the Andes to the Orinoco.  Curiously, in addition to noting the city of Manoa on Lake Parima, D'Anville also correctly maps the center of the ancient Manoan civilization between the Amazon tributaries Rio Negro and Rio Yapura.  Sadly the Manoa and many of the other populous South American indigenous nations noted by the earliest explores to the region vanished, brought low by European epidemics.  A similar error appears far to the south where the Paraguay rivers empties into the Laguna de Xarayes. The Xarayes, a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River, were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation.",1794 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/anville.txt,"Kitchin, Thomas, <i>Kitchin's General Atlas, describing the Whole Universe: being a complete collection of the most approved maps extant; corrected with the greatest care, and augmented from the last edition of D'Anville and Robert with many improvements by other eminent geographers, engraved on Sixty-Two plates, comprising Thirty Seven maps.</i>, Laurie & Whittle, London, 1797.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/SouthAmerica-laruiewhittle-1794.jpg,SouthAmerica-laruiewhittle-1794,46,39
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/India-jeffreys-1768,Antique Map: 1768 Jeffreys Wall Map of India and Ceylon,"The East Indies, with the Roads.","This is a staggering wall size map of India and Ceylon issued in 1768 by Thomas Jeffreys.  Covers the Indian subcontinent from Mekran in the west to Assam and Aracan in the east, and from Bhutan in the north, south to Ceylon and the Maldives.  Offers extraordinary detail throughout, with numerous notations on matters geographical, historical, and cultural.  Shows roads, caravan routes, oases, temples, cities, treaty lines, archeological sites, mountain ranges, lakes, swamps and rivers.  This map offers a smorgasbord of information for the historian interested political changes in India during the 18th century.  Identifies Delhi (or Shah Jehan Abad), Agra, Bombay, Goa, Calcutta, Pondicherry, and countless other major and minor cities.  Our map predates the definitive Alexander Dalrymple mapping of India in the 1770s and so is quite vague in a number of areas - especially those controlled the independent Maratha Confederacy southwest of Bihar.   In this area there are several speculative rivers as well as large lake, labeled Chilea or Ganga.  This is most likely an erroneous mapping of Chilka Lake (Chilika Lake).  Chilka Lake is the second largest salt water lagoon in the world - but was clearly missed by early mapmakers working on the Orissa coast.  Far to the north, just outside the border of the map, a note reads, A cow cut in the rock.  This is supposed to refer to the source of the Ganga or Ganges River.  In Hindi this site is called Gomukh, which translates literally as, The Cow's Mouth.  The site itself is a cave that does in fact somewhat resemble the mouth a cow - but in this case something seems to have been lost in translation.  In Assam, Jefferys maps the supposed locations of the apocryphal Lake of Chiamay. Early cartographers speculated that such a lake must exist as the source of four important Southeast Asian river systems including the Irrawaddy, the Dharla, the Chao Phraya, and the Brahmaputra. This lake began to appear in maps of this region as early as the 16th century and persisted well into the late 18th century. Its origins are unknown but may originate in a lost 16th century geography prepared by the Portuguese scholar Jao de Barros. It was also heavily discussed in the journals of Sven Hedin, who believed it to be associated with Indian mythology that a sacred lake linked several holy river systems. There are even records that the King of Siam led an invasionary force to take control of the lake in the 16th century. Nonetheless, the theory of Lake Chimmay was ultimately disproved and it disappeared from maps entirely by the 1780s.  On the far east of the map, Jefferys identifies the Kingdom of Arakan, which flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The city of Mrauk-U, marked here as Arakan, was once described by Portuguese merchants as one of the most beautiful locations on earth, is today a spectacular but derelict ruin.  All in all a spectacular map with much to offer and a welcome addition to any serious collection focusing on the subcontinent.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NewYorkCity-eddy-1828,Antique Map: 1828 Eddy Map of New York City and  30 Miles Around,Map of the country Thirty Miles Round the City of New York.,"Known as The Eddy Map, this is an extremely rare and important circular map of New York City and vicinity, dated 1823.  Covers the New York City area in roughly a thirty mile radius of Manhattan, extending north to Tarrytown, south to Monmouth, west to Somerset, and east to Suffolk County.  Isaac Stokes, in his 1928 classic on the iconography of Manhattan, calls this map one of the most complete, accurate, and beautiful early engraved maps showing New York and its environs.  It is also recorded that Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of this  map in his personal library.  Eddy's map offers impressive detail of the entire region at a time of rapid change and urban development.  Numerous family names and homesteads are noted, as are towns, toll booths (especially in New Jersey), canals, roads, proposed roadways, swamps, hills, forests, mineral deposits, bridges and ferries.  Specifically identifies Yorkville (M), Harlem (M), Manhattanville (M), Bloomingdale (M),  Brooklyn (B), Bedford (B), Bushwick (B), Williamsburg (B), Flatbush (Q), Flushing (Q) and Jamaica (Q), among countless other towns.   This is the second edition of the Eddy map, published in guide format in 1828 by Hooker and Blunt.  The first edition was published in 1811.  Subsequent revised editions were released in 1836, 1839 and 1842.  In 1846 J.H. Colton acquired the plates and significantly redesigned and re-engraved the plan adding contemporary urban detail, dropping out family names,  and incorporating a large decorative border.    Between the first (1811) and second (1828) editions, both of which were  engraved by Peter Maverick, there are a number of minor revisions.  Manhattan has been adjusted to reflect street grid developed for the 1811 Commissioners Plan and several family names, mostly in Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island, have been altered.  An elaborate dedication in the upper right hand corner reads, To His Excellency Dewitt Clinton Governor of the State of New York. This map is inscribed by his respectful friend, the Author.  Dewitt Clinton was the sixth governor of New York State and sponsored many of the most important early mappings of the state.  He died in 1828, the same year this map was published - though the dedication was also present in the 1811 edition.  Subsequent editions of this map removed the dedication.  This map was originally owned by the Embree family of Long Island.  This prominent New York family immigrated to the United States in 1644 and most records associate them with Huntington Long Island and Flushing queens.  Numerous  members of the family are known to have been prominent lawyers and industrialists.  Elihu Embree, of the most prominent members of the well to do family lobbied strongly against slavery and published an important anti-slavery newsletter titled  The Emancipator .  While all editions of this map are, for all intent and purposes, unobtainable, the first and second are the most highly regarded.  There are several important examples of this map in major collections, including the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, and the Rumsey Collection, however we have been unable to identify a single example of this map to appear on the open market in the last 40 years.

Uncommon, highly significant, and often underappreciated, this is 1849 map is the one of the first U.S. Coast Survey chart to depict the shoals off Nantucket.  Though the unpredictable waters off Nantucket were long a nemesis to sailing vessels on the important London – New York shipping routes, they had never been properly charted.  The harsh conditions, including rapid unexpected swells and frequent heavy fog, contrived to make the hydrographic survey of the hazards south of Nantucket one of the most dangerous and challenging projects of the early coast survey.    The first survey party to tackle this area was lead by the indomitable Lieutenant Commanding Charles H. Davis.  Starting at Old South Shoal, a known danger, Davis worked his way southward and soon discovered “New South Shoal”, which is here renamed “Davis Shoal” in his honor.  Working seasonally, it took the Coast Survey to 1853, fully seven years, to complete the survey of the Old South Shoal and Davis’ Shoal.  Bache himself discussed the difficult of accurately mapping the regions south and west of Nantucket in his 1852 Congressional Report:  The most difficult piece of hydrography on our coast has been completed during the past season. The area of broken ground east and south of the island of Nantucket is nearly seven hundred miles in extent, and is spread with dangers, some real and some only apparent. The work which has been prosecuted there perseveringly for some seasons has made the position of the dangers fully known, and has in turn employed the resources and taxed the perseverance of some of the most able hydrographers of the survey. It was commenced in 1846 by Lieut. C. H. Davis, U.S.N., has been continued since 1849 by Lieut. C. H. McBlair, and has this year been completed by Lieut. H. S. Stellwagen. The breaking of the water over these sunken shoals and banks ... which, under the name of Rips, occurs extensively over this region, serves, no doubt, to increase the terrors of the spot, though indicating in reality a change of depth, and not absolute shoalness. The outliers of this ground, Fishing Rip and Davis's Bank, have twenty-five and a half feet upon them, while on Great Rip, the Rose and Crown, Old South, and Davis's shoal, there are, respectively, but four, seven, six, and eight feet. The arrangement of these shoals led us to suppose that there must be dangers south of Davis's shoal, and several attempts have been made to look them up. The explorations of Lieutenant Commanding Stellwagen this year have completed the search over the space south of Davis's shoal to deep water, without any indication of another tier of banks. The hydrography of such ground as this is truly difficult; it must be surveyed with the minuteness of a harbor, without the facilities which neighboring land affords. The land cannot be seen from the deck of a vessel from Davis's shoal, and yet it must be traversed closely with the sounding line, and the position of the soundings be closely determined. It is necessary to establish bases from those on land by floating objects, which, like vessels, can be seen at a sufficient distance, and to preserve temporarily the positions of these floating stations by buoys. The first severe storm not only stops the actual sounding work, but is apt to break up the system entirely by removing or changing the position of these marks. The weather fit for surveying on that peculiarly stormy part of the coast is but a small fragment of each summer, and the harbors which must necessarily be sought as a refuge on the coming up of storms, which cannot be weathered in such exposed situations, are distant.",1849 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/uscs.txt,"<i>Report of the Superintendant of the United States Coast Survey,</i> Washington, (1849 edition).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Nantucket-uscs-1849.jpg,Nantucket-uscs-1849,17.5,16

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/GreatSaltLake-stansbury-1852,Antique Map: 1852 Stansbury Map of Utah and the Great Salt Lake,Map of the Great Salt Lake and Adjacent Country in the Territory of Utah.,"It had been a daring feat of exploration, succeeding where the mountain men had all failed, and by means of his map of the western portion of the lake, Stansbury had painted at least one more bold stroke into the unfinished portrait of the national landscape.     - William Goetzmann This is Stansbury's seminal 1852 map of the Great Salt Lake region in Utah.  It is considered to be the first accurate survey of the Great Basin as well as a cornerstone achievement in the mapping of the American West.  The first westerner to visit the Great Basin was most likely Silvestre Vélez de Escalante in the 1776, however, Escalante, who visited Utah Lake to the south, never truly laid eyes on Great Salt Lake.  That honor would fall to unnamed trappers and mountain men traveling the region in search of furs and other tradable commodities.  Unfortunately, few of these men were literate and did not record their discoveries.  The first scientific expedition to this area was headed up by Fremont in 1843.  Daunted by the season and climate, Fremont never circumnavigated the lake.  That task fell to Howard Stansbury who, in 1849, was assigned by Congress to survey the Great Salt Lake, the Utah Valley, and the emigrant roads passing through the region.  Stansbury, working with Gunnison, Carrington, and others, took about two years to complete his survey before presenting it to Congress in 1852.  This map was part of that presentation.  Covering the region of the Great Basin from the Bear River in the north to Mount Nebo in the south, and from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Great Plains in the east, Sansbury's map is the result of a monumental feat of exploration and scientific tenacity.  The detail throughout is extraordinary, identifying springs, rivers, passes, important buildings, American Indian settlements, canals, etc.  Stansbury's work and this map are responsible for creating much of the region's nomenclature, but where it is not, both Mormon and American Indian names are provided.  This is also one of the earliest maps to delineate the street plan of Salt Lake City.  Stansbury attempts to provide useful information for the traveler.  Both the Emigrant Road from California (passing north of the lake) and the Road From California (Passing South of the Lake) are shown.  He also provides useful notations for the traveler, such as this one in the lower left quadrant This desert consists of clay and sand impregnated with salt. When wet, it has the consistency of mortar. Lightly loaded wagons can pass between Spring Valley and Pilot Peak in the driest part of the season. Forage and water must be carried for cattle, and the journey begun in the P. M. and continued through the night. Distance between springs 70 ms. .  As much as possible, Stansbury includes nautical details and depth sounding for both Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake.  In the process of creating a marine survey of the Lake, the Stansbury team was also the first to identify and  chart  many of Great Salt Lake's Islands ,as might be deduced form their names: Stansbury Island, Carrington Island, Gunnison Island, and Fremont Island.  Wheat, in his classic study of American exploration,  Mapping the Transmississippi West , devotes  considerable attention to this important map,   Obviously a major production...an illuminating map of Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, their respective valleys, and a portion of ‘Youab’ (Juab) Valley to the south.... This map permanently established the cartography and many place names of northwestern Utah.... One of its most attractive features is that it gives the Indian as well as the Mormon names of the various creeks draining from the mountains. For Great Salt Lake itself the map was definitive, of course, permanent names being given to all the islands and shoreline features....",1852 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/stansbury.txt,"Stansbury, H.

Stansbury had painted at least one more bold stroke into the unfinished portrait of the national landscape.     - William Goetzmann This monumental map details Stansbury's seminal 1852 trek from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to the Great Salt Lake region of Utah.  It is considered to be the first accurate survey of the Great Basin and the southern Rocky Mountains, as well as a cornerstone achievement in the mapping of the American West.  The first westerner to visit the Great Basin was most likely Silvestre Vélez de Escalante in the 1776, however, Escalante, who visited Utah Lake to the south, never truly laid eyes on Great Salt Lake.  That honor would fall to unnamed trappers and mountain men traveling the region in search of furs and other tradable commodities.  Unfortunately, few  of these were literate.  The first scientific expedition to this area was headed up by Fremont in 1843.  Daunted by the season and climate, Fremont never circumnavigated the lake.  That task fell to Howard Stansbury who, in 1849, was assigned by Congress to survey the Great Salt Lake, the Utah Valley, and the emigrant roads passing through the region.  Stansbury, working with Gunnison, Carrington, and others, took about two years to complete their survey before presenting it to Congress in 1852.  This map was part of that presentation.  Covering the region from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to the Great Basin, Utah, Sansbury's map is the result of a monumental feat of exploration and scientific tenacity.

This is also one of the earliest maps to delineate the street grid of Salt Lake City.  As much as possible, Stansbury attempts to provide useful information for the traveler.  He notes the campsites where his team rested and offers dates for each.  Both the Emigrant Road from California (passing north of the lake) and the Road From California (Passing South of the Lake) are shown.  He also provides useful notations, such as this one just to the left of Great Salt Lake This desert consists of clay and sand impregnated with salt. When wet, it has the consistency of mortar. Lightly loaded wagons can pass between Spring Valley and Pilot Peak in the driest part of the season. Forage and water must be carried for cattle, and the journey begun in the P. M. and continued through the night. Distance between springs 70 ms. .  Stansbury also provides considerable with regard to the Rocky Mountains (Colorado and Wyoming), noting South Park, Middle Park, and North Park as well as Pikes Peak, Longs Peak, Laramie Peak, and others.  This map details the whole of Stansbury's 1849 to 1850 journey.  A year after his return, it was presented in Washington and received with great  acclaim. Gunnison, Stansbury's second,  was commissioned to return to the region the next  year in order to survey a viable route for the Pacific Railroad.  In the process of completing this project, Gunnison fell afoul of the local Ute (Utah) Indians, who killed him and several other members of his party in an ambush, delaying the survey and the development of the Pacific Railroad for a number of years.   Drawn by H. Gunnison and C. Pruss.  Published in 1852 as part of the  Stansbury Report , which was presented to congress in that same year.

Includes the modern day nations of Peru, Ecuador (here called Quito), Bolivia, and parts of adjacent Brazil, Columbia, Chile and Argentina.  Offers excellent detail throughout showing mountains, rivers, national boundaries, cities, regions, and tribes.    Curiously, this map identifies the Ancienne demeure des Manaos.  This was once a great trading empire was centered along the Rio Negro in the Amazon Basin.  The Manoa traded from Peru to the Orinoco.  There were perhaps most famously encountered by Sir Walter Raleigh in Guyana while on an annual trading expedition to the region.  Raleigh, seeing the gold artifacts carried by the traders immediately assumed they must be from El Dorado.  He asked local tribesmen who they were and where they came from.  The locales responded that they crossed a great lake and came from a rich land called Manoa.  Though at the time Raleigh did not explore this further, he did later write that he discovered the great city of Manoa, capital of El Dorado, on a vast lake in Guyana.  No doubt Raleigh intended to return to South America but was prevented from doing so by his unfortunate beheading back in England.  As a result of Raleigh's guess work, the Lake of Parima and city of Manoa would appear for several hundred years on maps of northern South America.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Paraguay-bonne-1771,"Antique Map: 1771 Bonne Map of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil",Carte du Paraguay et partie des Pays adjacants.,"A beautiful example of Rigobert Bonne's decorative map of Paraguay.  Covers from the Rio de la Plata north well into Brazil and the Amazon, extends westward as far as Cordova,  and eastward to San Salvador, Brazil.  Includes the modern day nations of Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of adjacent Brazil and Argentina.  Offers excellent detail throughout showing mountains, rivers, national boundaries, cities, regions, and tribes. Identifies Buenos Aires, Rio de Janiero, and numerous other important South American cities.  Perhaps it most interesting element, this map offers a classic representation of the apocryphal Lake of Xarayes at the northern terminus of the Paraguay River. Xarayes is a corruption of Xaraiés meaning Masters of the River. The Xaraiés were an indigenous people occupying what are today parts of Brazil's Matte Grosso and the Pantanal. When Spanish and Portuguese explorers first navigated up the Paraguay River, as always in search of El Dorado, they encountered the vast Pantanal flood plain at the height of its annual inundation. Understandably misinterpreting the flood plain as a gigantic inland sea, they named it after the local inhabitants, the Xaraies. The Laguna de los Xarayes almost immediately began to appear on early maps of the region and, at the same time, almost immediately took on a legendary aspect as the gateway to El Dorado.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SouthAmericaNorth-bonne-1771,Antique Map: 1771 Bonne Map of Tierra Firma or Northern South America,"Carte de La Terre Ferme, de la Guyane et du Pays des Amazones.","A beautiful example of Rigobert Bonne's decorative map of northern South America.  Covers from Honduras and the Windward Isles south as far as 12 degrees south latitude.  This region, known since the days of Columbus as Tierra Firma, consists of the modern day nations of Columbia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana, and Brazil.  Offers excellent detail throughout showing mountains, rivers, national boundaries, cities, regions, and tribes.    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this map is Bonne's treatment of the apocryphal Lake Parima. Lake Parima was first identified by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century - though he admittedly never saw the lake himself. Raleigh associated the lake with indigenous legends of Manoa and the supposed site of El Dorado. Many early maps actually show El Dorado on the shores of Lake Parima, though Bonne curiously does not.  The reality of Lake Parima and the Manoans is based upon Raleigh's misinterpretation of local trade networks. The Manoas were a river trading tribe based in the Amazon. Each year during the rainy season flooding on the Orinoco and Parima rivers would create a large flood plain and open channels of trade between the two otherwise unconnected regions. Raleigh misinterpreted these watery trade channels as a great lake.   Curiously, despite the popularity of Raleigh's assumptions, the true homeland of the Manoa, along the Rio Negro, was known by the early 18th century.  This map actually identifies the Ancienne demeure des Manaos in the correct region.  This once a great trading empire was defeated in the earliest years of European exploration of the regions by a series of terrifying Small Pox outbreaks - no doubt carried by the explorers themselves.

Covers northwestern Africa and the western Mediterranean.  This region, known since the days of Columbus as Tierra Firma, consists of the modern day nations of Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Morocco.  Offers excellent detail throughout showing mountains, rivers, national boundaries, cities, regions, and tribes.  As Bonne was preparing this map, the Barbary Coast was a hotbed of piracy - much like the Somali coast today.  The Barbary Pirates would attack trading ships passing through the narrow Gibraltar straits and western Mediterranean.  Ships would be destroyed or appropriated, cargo sized, and the crews and passengers enslaved.  By the early 19th century, piracy in this region had become so intense that the United States launched its first major naval offensive against Tripoli.  The resultant 1805 Battle of Derne later inspired a portion of the lyrics of the  Marines' Hymn ,  the shores of Tripoli.   A large decorative title cartouche appears in the lower left quadrant.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/GreatLakes-bonne-1775,Antique Map: 1775 Bonne Map of the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi,"Partie Occidentale du Canada, contenant les cinq Grands Lac, avec les Pays Circonviosins.","An extremely attractive example of Rigobert Bonne's c. 1775 map of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi Valley.   A map of considerable importance, this map was constructed during a period of aggressive exploration into this region.  The French and English in North America, jealous of Spain's access to the Pacific via Mexico and Central America, were actively seeking their own westward passage'.  By this time notions of a Northwest Passage through the Arctic were largely dismissed. Instead merchants and explorers turned their eyes inland towards the great system of Lakes and Rivers that filled the North American interior.  With no concept that the vast barrier of the Rocky Mountains stood in their way - the idea that a river route to the Pacific was not only reasonable, but a likely possibility.   One of the more likely courses for this route is shown here - one can pass through the Great Lakes and, roughly following the current US-Canada border, pass upriver to Rainey  Lake (L. Tecamamiouen)and then, through another River, to the Lake of the Woods (Lac des Bois), then, via another river, to (though it does not appear on this map) Lake Winnipeg.  Here the water route westward ends - though at the time they didn't know it.  Throughout this map, Bonne attempt to document rivers, mountains, forts, and American Indian tribes and villages with the most recent data obtainable.  He identifies the lands of  the Sioux, the Iroquois (Five Nations), the Algonquians, the Illinois, and many others.  Chicago (Chicagou) and Detroit both appear as forts.  The Great Lakes are mapped with a rough approximation of accuracy, though Lake Superior does include a number of apocryphal islands including I. Ponchartrain and I. Minong (also known as Phillipeaux).   These islands first appeared Bellin's mapping of the region in 1750s and continued to appear until the 1820s.    Drawn by R.

Woolworth Colton's New Map of New York City, Brooklyn, Jersey City, Hoboken, Etc.","An extremely rare example of G. Woolworth Colton's 1867 vertical pocket map of New York.  This important map, first issued in 1865, marks a significant rethinking of the standard Manhattan map. Previous maps of New York City tended to represent only the lower parts of Manhattan (on the Burr model) or orient the city horizontally with the top of the map facing west (as in the Commissioner's Plan).  With the opening of Central Park in the mid 1860s, the previously rural northern portions of the city became not only accessible, but desirable destinations.  Map publishers of the period, most notably Colton and Johnson, were forced to reconsider their mappings in order to more properly locate Central Park and its environs in the heart of New York City.  This pocket map was most likely initially issued in 1865 as a prototype to test the new map before it was included in the Colton's Atlas of 1866.  Johnson began including a very similar map,  with slight modifications, in his atlas starting in 1867.  As a pocket map, we have identified three issues, 1865, 1866, and this, 1867.  While all three editions are extremely rare, the 1865 and 1866 issues do appear in a couple of institutional collections, most notably the New York Public Library, Map Division.  This, however, is the only example of the 1867 edition for which we have found any reference whatsoever.  The map itself is oriented to the north and covers Manhattan Island from  Battery Park to 125th Street.  Also covered are adjacent portions of Brooklyn (Williamsburg and Greenpoint), Queens (Long Island City, Hunter's Point, Ravenswood, and Astoria),Jersey City and Hoboken. Central Park is shown in full with excellent interior detail.  An inset in the upper left quadrant details upper Manhattan and parts of what is today the Bronx, but was then Westchester.   Throughout Colton identifies streets, avenues, city wards, ferries, piers, rail lines, and even important buildings.  A chart in the lower right quadrant offers more information with regard to the city's various railroads. This map is copyrighted to 1865 in the lower left quadrant, but updated below the imprint to 1867.

Depicts the state of California and the territories of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.  Offers superb detail throughout noting mining districts, emigrant trails, the Santa Fe Trail, the Pony Express Route and several proposed railroads, as well as American Indian tribes, geological features, and local political divisions. Features the fretwork border common to Johnson’s atlas work from 1864 to 1869.  This important map went through several different states during its publication period from 1861 to 1870.  This critical period of westward expansion saw incredible development and change throughout the region.  Collecting the various states of this map has become something of a sub-genre for south-western map aficionados.   Johnson updated the plates for this map annually and sometimes even issued multiple variants the course of a single year.  This example, which was introduced in 1864, represents a complete re-engraving of the 1862-1863 map.  Johnson added considerable detail in the mountainous regions of California, Nevada, and Colorado.  Arizona and New Mexico appear as independent territories but, for the most part, adhere to the old “New Mexico” county structure.  The southern boundary of Nevada with Arizona is set at 37 degrees of Latitude such that Las Vegas, which is noted, rests firmly within Arizona.   The Utah-Nevada Border is set at 115 degrees of Longitude, roughly one degree further west than it is today.

Johnson first introduced this map in 1865 to accommodate a renewed interested in this region following the close of the American Civil War.  During the Civil War period the vast Washington and Nebraska territories had been divided up into smaller territories including Idaho (1863), Montana (1864) and Dakota (1861).  Though largely controlled by various American Indian nations, this region was becoming increasingly attractive for settlement and development.  The proposed Governor Stevens route for the Northern Pacific Railroad passed through this region, as this region as did the more favorable Central Pacific Railroad route and, to a lesser extent, the proposed Union Pacific Railroad route.   This is also the first Johnson map to incorporate Wyoming - which is absent from the 1865 edition of this map.  Note that, though Wyoming is demarked as a territory, the lettering of the territorial title is in a light outline typeface - a sharp contrast to the bold titles for Montana, Dakota, and Idaho.  This is due to the fact that though the territory of Wyoming had been proposed by Representative J. M. Ashley of Ohio in 1865, it was considered a temporary measure.  The region was not officially incorporated as a territory until 1868. This early configuration of the territory also truncates the border with Montana at 44.5 degrees north latitude, giving Wyoming a curious ephemeral western panhandle.  Within Montana the western portions beyond the Rocky Mountains, are highlighted and identified as Missoula.  In 1865 this region had only recently been settled by traders and missionaries.  Nonetheless, by 1866 it has become a stopping point for the Mullans Wagon Road, which is also identified.   Throughout this map Johnson offers spectacular detail identifying explorers routes, mines, American Indian Nations, springs, forts, mountain passes, and an assortment of additional geographical and political elements.  In particular he identifies all three proposed routes for the Pacific Railroad, the Emigrant Road, gold deposits in Montana and Idaho, Pike's Peak, Fremont's Peak, and Yellowstone Lake.  Though copyrighted to 1865, this map was updated by Johnson for publication as plate nos. 62-63 in the 1866 edition of his  New Illustrated Atlas…   This is the last edition of the Johnson’s  Atlas  to bear the Johnson and Ward imprint and the first to include Wyoming.",1866 (dated 1865),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/johnson.txt,"Johnson, A.

To quote from the document itself:  In studying this pictorial map the spectator is supposed to be stationed somewhere in mid air above Fort Hamilton, at the outlet of the [Verrazano] Narrows, from which convenient height he can cast his eye of all the century lying with a radius of eighteen miles of New York.  In the center he will see the great metropolis, with its busy marts and wharves, its splendid Park (Central Park) and the surrounding islands.  On the right, the city of Brooklyn, and the town lying eastward as far as Jamaica and Hempstead, and northward as far as New Rochelle, with the railroads that make them suburbs of New York, and the islands and headlands of the Sound.  On the left he will see Staten Island, with its picturesque villas, Jersey City, Newark, and all the pleasant suburban villages and towns of New Jersey as far south as Perth Amboy, westward to West Orange, and northward to Caldwell and Paterson.  Following the course of the Hudson, he will see all the towns and places of interest on the banks between New York and Yonkers, which can be reached either by railroad or by the various lines of steamboats that, during the spring, summer and autumn month, enliven the surface of that river.  Some of the most pleasant excursions that can be made are connected with places of picturesque or historic interest along these shores.  The map illustrates the growth of New York, and indicates what would have been the territorial extent of  the metropolis of the Western World but for its cramped position between two wide and deep rivers.  The surrounding cities and villages on each side in reality belong to New York, with which they are connected by means of transit so rapid that the merchant or broker doing business in the lower part of the town can rich his house in Orange, Elizabeth, College Point, Jamaica, or Hempstead in less time that the street cars or stages would take him to the region of Central Park.

Shows the state divided into several hundred numbered plats, some of which are marked with an “S” to state that they had been fully surveyed, and some with a “T” suggesting that they had only been surveyed externally.  Labels several important Seminole War Forts including Fort Bassinger, Fort Center, Fort Thompson, Fort Beynaud, Fort Adams, and others.  Notes the Everglades, Big Cypress, Fort Lauderdale, Lake Okeechobee, and many of Florida’s lakes and river systems.  Also shows both the Arrendondo Grant and Forbes Purchase.  Arredondo Grant is a layover of the Spanish Land Grant program, which bequeathed it to a powerful Spanish merchant - Arrendondo. With incredible difficulty and protest, the land grants were dissolved when Florida became part of the United States. Forbes Purchase refers to a large tract of land in the Florida Panhandle that was purchased from Spain by three American traders in the late 18th century. After Florida became part of the United States there was an attempt by the government to seize this land, but it was shot down by the United States Supreme Court. Unfortunately, as Forbes Purchase was mostly uninhabitable swampland, it was impossible to develop and later sold off in lots.  The map is dated to 1853 and attributed John Wescott, Surveyor General.   Wescott (here misprinted as Wescoll) took the office of Florida Surveyor General in 1853.

In 1666 the Great Fire swept through the old Roman portions of London, laying waste to most of the original walled city.  Christopher Wren, a well known architect of the period was quick to respond to the disaster as a opportunity to dramatically redesign and modernize London's center.  Wren having been schooled in Paris envisioned an elaborate classically influenced reconstruction of the city with broad avenues meeting in a series of Piazzas.  Despite, or perhaps because of, Wren's promptitude in producing a plan for a major post-fire reconstruction, his plan exhibits a number of dramatic errors.  Wren did not take the city's topography into account and consequently much of the this plan is unfeasible.  Despite claims to the contrary in the document itself, Wren's plan was never seriously considered by either the King or the Parliament.   Today Wren's original 1666 plan is lost.  This version was drawn in 1744 by the once fashionable engrave P. Fourdrinier, who claims to have replicated exactly a scarce 1724 original owned by the Earl of Pembroke.  This map covers London along the north side of the Thames River from Strand Bridge to Great Tower Hill.  Shows Wren's detailed reconstruction plan, along with the regions originally destroyed by the Great Fire.  Identifies the proposed locations of parochial churches, markets, piazzas,  bridges and warehouses.  A vignette in the lower left quadrant depicts Thamesis, the river god for which the Thames River is named.  The upper left quadrant bears the image of a phoenix, suggesting that, like the  mythical bird, London too would rise from its own ashes and be reborn in fire.

Covers the North Atlantic from rough 5 degree south latitude to roughly 56 degrees north latitude.  Includes much of North America, all of the West Indies and Caribbean, Central America, the northern parts of South America, Western Africa, Ireland, and parts of Western Spain.  As a whole Mortier's map presents a moderately accurate picture of the Americas.  The coast lines, particularly in North America are a unnaturally craggy.  Florida takes on an inverted cone aspect.  The barrier islands and capes off the coast of Virginia and Carolina are noted, but inaccurately represented. The Chesapeake Bay is slightly diminished in size.  The entrance to the Mississippi River is either not apparent or confused with the conjectural Rio de Spirito Sancto.  This river, most likely associated with early entradas into Mobile Bay, was confused with the Mississippi on numerous older maps.  Politically, Mortier recognizes the French claims to Canada, the British claims to the region between New York and the St. Lawrence, Dutch claims to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, and Spanish Claims to Florida. Identifies New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Staten Island, Long Island, Cape Hatteras, Cape Look (Cape Lookout), Port Royal, St Augustine and Havana, among others.  Like most maritime charts this map has very little inland detail but a high level of nautical detail.  Identifies thousands of coastal destinations throughout as well as offshore shoals, reefs, and other undersea dangers.  Mortier additionally maps various shipping routes between Europe and the Americas.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Anemographica-jannson-1650,"Antique Map: 1650 Jansson Wind Rose, Anemographic Chart, or Map of the Winds",Tabula Anemographica seu Pyxis Nautica Ventorum Nomina Sex Linguis Repraesentans.,"An exceptionally rare example of one of the earliest and most significant anemographic, or wind rose, charts to appear in the 17th century.  This unusual chart represents a transitional point in the perception of direction, or to be precise, the transition from the wind rose to the compass rose.  Early mariners in the Mediterranean defined direction by the names the various winds and the points from which they blew. This idea traces its roots to ancient Greece.  Homer identified four cardinal winds, but as navigation and cartography advanced, more were added.  This chart represents a full thirty-two named winds and a multitude of different wind systems.  Each of the winds is identified by several different names in Greek, Latin, French, and Dutch.   Each wind is additionally attached to  both contemporary compass points, north west east and south, and a more sophisticated circle and degree system.  In the areas surrounding the sphere, each wind is personified by a figure bearing the racial characteristics associated with the region or direction represented.  The upper left quadrant, representing north, depicts bearded Germans or Scandinavians.  The upper right, representing east, shows beardless dark skinned faces.  The beardless and pale skinned figures in the lower left and right, representing west and south, are less distinguishable but may be intended to represent indigenous Americans and Greeks.  Anemographic charts, like this, were functional objects and valuable reference tools. Early navigators, referring to the directions as winds, might sail by the north wind.   This was exceptionally practical when trade winds dictated ocean commerce.  A warm wind from the south, for example might suggest that certain routes, closed for part of the year, were now open.  A navigator would have used this chart to compare different names for directions.  So, he may be using a chart made in Greece that identified the winds by the names of Greek gods, but himself been trained to use to a different, say Catalan or English, nomenclature.  With this chart, he could figure out what various sailing logs and navigation books were referring to.  Remember, while nautical charts did exist in the 1600s, most navigation was accomplished using Pilot Books that had instructions like this follow the south wind for 3 days before turning with the eastern wind etc.  Thus this was a very useful object indeed.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/OrbisTerrarum-jansson-1650,Antique Map: 1650 Jansson Map of the Ancient World,Orbis Terrarus Veteribus Cogniti Typus Geographicus.,"An exceptional 1650 map of the world as it was known to the ancients by Jan Janssonius.  Such maps, which filled in contemporary geography with ancient place names, were popular in the post-Renaissance period.  Scholars digging through rediscovered Greek and Roman texts needed a geographical reference point for the numerous place names that peppered these works.   Such maps began appearing in 16t century.  This particular example is a significant reworking of an earlier chart by A. Ortelius.   It covers Europe, western Asia, and Northern Africa as well as significant, though blank, portions of the surrounding seas.  Jansson has curiously oriented this chart with Africa at the center.  As such Europe and Asia seem to take on an almost peripheral role.  Countless ancient world place names, most of which are drawn from Ptolemy's  Geographica , are included.  Jansson also notes all five climatic zones, the frigid zones in the north and south, the habitable temperate zones to the north and south of the tropics, and the inhospitable torrid zone to either side of the Equator.  Cartographically this map does not stray too far from the standard model of the period.  In Africa the Mountains of the Mood as well as the Likes of the Nile are identified.  The Caspian Sea is incorrectly oriented on a east-west axis.  Sri Lanka is identified with Tapobrana.  In Southeast Asia, the five great rivers of the region are shown to originate from the apocryphal lake known, though not labeled here, as Chaimay. Various fishing, sailing, and merchant ships, as well as the odd sea monster, fill the unknown seas. This example represents the second state of this map with a fully developed dedication at bottom center.  The first state of the chart left this area blank.   A baroque title area complete with cherubs occupies the upper part of the plate.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/ErythraeanSea-jansson-1658,Antique Map: 1658 Jansson Map of the Indian Ocean (Erythrean Sea) in Antiquity,Erythraei Sive Rubri Maris Periplus.,"An unusual and attractive 1658 map of the Indian Ocean, or Erythraean Sea, as it was in antiquity.  Composed by Jan Jansson after a similar 1597 map published by A.  Ortelius in his  Parergon .  Covers from Egypt and the Nile valley eastward past Arabia and India, to Southeast Asia and Java.  Cartographically, India, Arabia, and Africa roughly correspond to the conventions of the period.  Southeast Asia is less recognizable, but the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Java are clearly noted.  Most of the place names used throughout are derived from Ptolemy, who himself based his description of the region heavily on records from Alexander the Great's conquests.  Two smaller maps in the upper left and right quadrants are of exceptional interest.  The upper left chart shows northwestern Africa and is titled Annonis Periplus.  This is a reference to the legendary expeditions of the Carthaginian King Hanno, said to have been the first to access the Indian Ocean by sailing around the southern tip of Africa.  Incidentally, en route, he is also said to have been the first to tame a lion.  The upper right chart shows the northern polar regions as they were perceived at the time.  A landmass covering the polar ice cap is indentified as Hyperborea.  To the left of this, roughly where North America rests today, the island of Atlantis appears; while Scythia, Europe (Thule) and Asia are on the right.  Greenland and possibly Iceland appear at the bottom.  This map is intended to point out the possibility of a Northeast Passage to Asia, which was at the time being actively sought after by Dutch, English, and Russian navigators.  Both smaller maps, the primary title area at top center, and an Latin explanation for the map at bottom center,  are surrounded by baroque strapwork style borders.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/ChesapeakeBay-uscs-1893,Antique Map: 1893 U.S. Coast Survey Nautical Chart or Map of the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay,Delaware and Chesapeake Bays.,"This is a rare example of the 1893 U.S. Coast Survey Map or Nautical Chart of the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay.  This chart is based on survey work initiated in 1855 and has been updated to 1893.   Covers from Philadelphia south as Cape Henry and Norfolk.    Includes both the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay in full, as well as significant portions of the Potomac River, Rappahannock River, York River, James River, Patapsco River, and Patuxent River.  Includes the major centers of Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Wilmington, Baltimore, and Richmond.  Offers stupendous detail both inland and at sea.  Notes all major railroads,  communities, and shoreline features.  Nautically, this map really shines.  There are thousands of depth soundings, shading for undersea shoals and other dangers, and red and yellow color coding for buoys, light ships, and lighthouses.    This chart is not to be confused with the similar folded charts that are commonly issued in the  Annual Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey .  Rather it is an independently issued chart on heavy stock.  It has never been folded.  Most likely this chart has actually been used to sail.  Such charts are much less common and far more desirable than the folded  Report  charts.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SantoDomingo-stockdale-1800,"Antique Map: 1800 Stockdale Map of Hispaniola or Santo Domingo, West Indies (Haiti, Dominican Republic)",A Map of the Island of St. Domingo.,"A dramatic and important map of the island of St. Domingo (Santo Domingo) or Hispaniola prepared by Bryan Edwards and published by John Stockdale in 1800.   Covers the island in full offering significant detail throughout.  Edwards includes notations of the navigability of various rives, comments on habitation and population, reveals the nature of the landscape, and identifies cities and roads as they existed.   He also includes the line of demarcation between French and Spanish portions of the island as defined in 1776.  These divisions would later evolve into Haiti and the Dominican Republic as we know them today. Edwards further identifies the Mountains of Cibao, where Columbus notoriously sought for gold.  This map, originally included in Edwards's history of the British Colonies in the West Indies, represents a significant reconsideration of the island.  In the preperations of this map, Edwards sourced and supervised numerous independent surveys and studies of various parts of the island.  Following its initial publication, Edwards' mapping of St. Domingo became so significant that it was copied by a number by a number of other map publishers who attempted to claim it as their own.  This resulted in landmark British copyright case in which Edwards asserted his claims on the map and which, ultimately, set precedent for future cases involving cartographic copyright infringement in the United Kingdom.",1800 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/edwardsbryan.txt,"Edwards, Bryan, <i>The History Civil and Commercial of the British Colonies of the West Indies</i>, 1800.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/SantoDomingo-stockdale-1800.jpg,SantoDomingo-stockdale-1800,36,18

Depicts all of Mexico and much of the United States shortly following the acquisition of Louisiana but prior to the acquisition of Florida, Texas and Upper California.  This map exhibits a curious ephemeral mapping of the American Southwest based upon the Dominguez-Escalante expedition of 1776 and 1777 and Zebulon Pike's expedition of 1806.  Both Lake Timpanagos (Great Salt Lake) and Lake Teguyo (Utah Lake) are appear - though both are speculative and malformed at this point.

Planche,"A curious c. 1728 mapping of the ancient world and the cosmos rendered from an arcane Biblical perspective.  Though composed well after the discovery of the New World and the circumnavigations of Magellan and Drake, this two part diagram represents a very medieval view of the world. The upper map, though ostensibly the Eastern Hemisphere, actually follows a medieval doctrine advocated by Francis Bacon.  That is, the belief that the physical earth was large ball of rock resting within a great sphere of water.  The habitable lands of the earth, Asia, Europe, and Africa, were pieces of this rock that emerged from the waters when God caused the  ball of rock, Earth, to float in the northern part of the watery sphere - much as a baseball might float in a bucket of water.  This argument was used in the middle ages to prove that the antipodes, or the lands south of the equator, must not emerge from the sea, for necessarily, if the earth is floating at the northern part of the watery sphere, the southern parts must be covered fully by deep seas.  Hence the darker shading, indicating fathomless depths, in the southern parts of the map.  The lower sphere depicts the cosmos from a pre-Copernican perspective.  Earth rests at the center of the universe, around which the Moon, Sun (here drawn as benevolent God), and the stars rotate.  The curious diagram was included in Augustin Calmet's influential 18th century Biblical dictionary.",1728 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/calmet.txt,"Calmet, Augustin, <i>Dictionnaire Historique Critique, Chronologique, Geographique de la Bible</i>, 1728.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/AncientWorld-calmet-1728.jpg,AncientWorld-calmet-1728,8,12.5
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthAmerica-tardieu-1810,Antique Map: 1809 Tardieu Map of North America,Amerique Septentrionale.,"A highly uncommon and desirable 1810 map of North America by the French cartographer Ambrose Tardieu.  Depicts all of North America including Canada, Mexico the United States at a formative but ephemeral period shortly following the U.S. acquisition of Louisiana but prior to both the acquisition of Florida, Texas and Upper California, and the 54°40' Oregon boundary dispute.   Mexico controls much of what is today the Southwestern United States and California.  As this map was being produced several major events were in process that would eventually redefine the cartography of the region, but Tardieu had access to little of this information.  Instead he relies on old Spanish records, speculations, and the data collected by the Dominguez-Escalante expedition of 1776 and 1777 and Zebulon Pike's expedition of 1806.  Both Lake Timpanagos (Great Salt Lake) and Lake Teguyo (Utah Lake) are appear - though both are speculative and malformed at this point.  Also shows are speculative courses of the Colorado River in the Rocky Mountains.  Louisiana is joined to the united states by the map's color coding, but demarcated along the Mississippi River as a distinctly separate zone.  The northwestern boundaries of Louisiana in what is today British Columbia, Oregon and Washington, remain indistinct.     Tardieu recognizes Russian Claims to Alaska as well as French and British Claims to Canada and certain properties in the West Indies.   In the far north hopeful traces of the Northwest Passage remain, with the seas identified by Mackenzie and Hearne - likely the Dolphin and Union Strait - duly noted.  Greenland is also, curiously , attached to the mainland.

Etc.","An absolutely stunning example of Cornelius Danckerts' important 1696 map of Florida, the West Indies, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Spanish Main.  Cartographically influenced by Blaeu's 1636 map of the same region, this map covers from Mexico to the Antilles and from Florida to the Spanish Main, inclusive of Cuba, the Bahamas, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Porto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles.  The detail throughout is spectacular with missions, forts, cities, ports, rivers, lakes, indigenous groups, and an assortment of additional topographical details noted.  Florida is labeled as the province of Tegesta, following the convention established by Dutch cartographers Johannes de Laet and Hessel Gerritzoon in 1630.  The Tegesta were an indigenous tribe active in the southeastern parts of Florida, around what is today Miami-Dade.  They were encountered in the 16th century by Ponce de Leon and by one of the ships commanded by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés.   Though largely subject to the more powerful tribes of western Florida, the Tegesta were among the first of Florida's indigenous groups to encounter Europeans and subsequently influenced the naming of Florida for some 200 years.  Curiously, despite several expeditions and interesting earlier maps of Florida, Dankerts has chosen to leave the interior blank, noting neither the Everglades nor any of Florida's great lakes.  The interesting cartographic decision to discard all previous mappings of the Florida region contrasts strikingly with the remainder of the map, which is lavishly and often speculative detailed.  Following the western coast of Florida north, along the Gulf and then west towards Texas and Mexico, we can begin to see just how little was known of the Gulf Coast despite nearly 200 years of European activity in the region.  The Mississippi River is entirely absent, though a great fan shaped river system does radiate northward from the Bay of Spiritu Santo (today most commonly associated with Galveston Bay).  Looking northward and inland from the Gulf Coast, a number of communities appear in reference to various indigenous groups encountered by the De Soto and Coronado expeditions - these include the Chicasa, the Talacasa (whose warriors nearly overwhelmed and slaughtered De Soto's army), and Achusi.  The West India Islands, centered on Cuba, are mapped with considerable accuracy though universally distorted on the north-south axis.  The Bahamas are vaguely and inaccurately mapped throughout, though some attempt has been made to depict the undersea Bahama Bank.  San Salvador or Guanahani, the supposed island where Columbus is said to have first landed in the New World, is noted.  Central America, which sweeps diagonally across the lower left quadrant of the map is strikingly accurate with the exception of a distorted Yucatan - which here appears almost like an inversion of a similarly distorted Florida just to the northeast.  Both Lake Nicaragua and the adjacent Lake Managua  are noted, but are situated on an east-west rather than the correct north-south axis.   Along the Spanish Main the great trading cities of Cartagena, Venezuela, and Valentia are noted,  ss are a number of missions and indigenous centers in the interior.   Maracaibo Bay is entirely misrepresented.  Further east, Dankerts attempts to illustrate the countless islands of the Orinoco Delta.   A title cartouche including two cherubs appears in the upper right quadrant.  A key to the map's symbols, three distance scales, and an secondary Dutch description of the map appears above the map's printed border.    The description declares that this map was made to illustrate the theater of war in the West Indies.  The war in question is most likely the Nine Years' War (1688–97), fought between France and England over control of the New World.",1696 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/dankerts.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/WestIndies-dankerts-1696.jpg,WestIndies-dankerts-1696,22,18.5

Covers from Burma south to Java and from the Andaman Islands eastward as far as the Philippines and New Guinea.  Includes the entire Malay Peninsula, much of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam), Sumatra, Java, Borneo and the Philippines.  Pinkerton offers impressive detail throughout noting indigenous groups, forts, towns and cities, swamps, mountains, and river systems.  Known regions such as Java and Sumatra are full of interesting notes and commentary, such as the sites of various gold mines, plantations, notes on river navigation,  and comments on the terrain. Lesser known areas, such as New Guinea and the interior of Borneo, often feature simpler comments suchas Fresh Water or Lava.  The island of Singapore, spelled Sincapoor is identified.  The island of Rakata, spelled Rakama, where Krakatoa famously erupted in 1883, destroying the island in its entirety, is also identified.  Further identifies the important centers of Siam, Bangkok, Malacca, Pegu, Rangoon, Manila, etc.  Possibly the finest mapping of the region to appear in the 19th century.   Drawn by L.

Covers from Borneo south past Australia as far as Tasmania, and New Zealand.  Pinkerton offers detail as he is able, but in 1808, when this map was being composed, this part of the world remained for the most part unexplored.  New Guinea, New Zealand and Australia, had, around this time, been mapped only tentatively and then only their coastlines.  In Southern Australia and New Guinea, even this was vague, as Pinkerton notes along the coast, Very Imperfectly Known.   Only two significant islands are shown for New Zealand with Rakiura Island attached to the mainland.  All around Australia, Pinkerton offers copious notations regarding the activities of various exploring missions to the region, including P. Nuyt, Dinnings, Edels, C. F. De Witt, Esdracht, Dampier, Van Diemen, and others.  In Polynesia the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Fiji , Queen Charlottes Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands are identified.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthAmerica-pinkerton-1818,Antique Map: 1818 Pinkerton Map of North America,North America.,"This is an extremely unusual mapping of North America prepared for the 1818 American edition of Pinkerton's Atlas.  Although the basic engraving remains identical to Pinkerton's Atlas of 1813, published in London, the coloration has been updated to reflect American sensibilities.  Where the British edition leaves the borders in the northwest somewhat vague, this edition draws a specific line roughly along the 50th parallel that descends at an angle west of the Rockies to meet the sea around Mt. Rainier.    Further, while the London edition attributes Spanish dominion to all lands west of the Mississippi, this edition identifies Louisiana west of the Red River and south of the 40th parallel.  Cartographically Pinkerton's map presents a curious amalgam of Soulard, Escalante, Pike and Lewis and Clark.  Wheat suggests that Pinkerton struggled to reconcile conflicting reports from Soulard and Pike, particularly in the Missouri Basin.  He introduces the curious convention of showing a dashed line noting the route of the Missouri River according to former conjectures.  Further to the south he notes the path of the Missouri according to M. Lewis.  The great basin is particularly vague, with the Great Salt Lake, or rather an embryonic version of it, appearing much further west than is common.   It also shows the apocryphal Buenaventura river flowing into the lake from the mountains in the northeast.  Pikes Peak appears, but is not named.  Florida is attached to the Spanish dominions. We are not certain to whom to ascribe the variations of coloring apparent on this map as we have not been able to compare it with a similar map from the rare 1818 edition, which has proven extremely elusive.  In the far north hopeful traces of the Northwest Passage remain, with the seas identified by Mackenzie and Hearne - likely the Dolphin and Union Strait - duly noted.  Greenland is also, in a curiously advanced step forward , detached from the mainland.    Drawn by L. Herbert and engraved by Samuel Neele under the direction of John Pinkerton.   This particular edition further recognizes Bradford &amp; Inskeep and Moses Thomas, an important Philadelphia scholar and author of several important works on Lewis and Clark.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Africa-pinkerton-1818,Antique Map: 1818 Pinkerton Map of Africa,Africa.,"This is John Pinkerton's stunning 1818 map of Africa.  Nineteenth century mapmakers were particularly challenged by the difficult task of deciphering Africa.  Despite a fairly constant flow of information about the continent dating to the middle ages, much of the interior remained speculative at best.  Pinkerton, straying from the path of his 18th century predecessors chooses to leave much of the interior blank and instead focuses known areas, or more precisely, areas perceived to be known.  These include Mediterranean North Africa, Egypt, Abyssinia, the western Niger valley, the Congo, South Africa, and the lands of Monomotapa (Zimbabwe).  Each of these regions have their own unique history of European contact.  Egypt, along the Nile, had been well mapped even in Antiquity.  The same is true of Christian Abysinnia who, through regular contact with the Coptic mother church in Egypt, was well known, if mostly unexplored by Europeans.  The tale of European incursion and occupation of South Africa could easily encompass volumes and explains Pinkerton's sophisticated mapping of this area.  The Niger Valley and the Congo had been simultaneously exploited and explored by Portugal and later Belgium since the 1300s.   Monomotapa, opposite the island of Madagascar, was a major stopping point on the Portuguese trade routes to India.  Curiously this region has also been associated with King Solomon's Mines and Biblical legends of the Land of Ophir.  Pinkerton doesn't specifically mention the Kingdom of Monomotapa, or Mutapa, which by this time had long fallen into decline, but he does he does identify several of its constituent states including Manica, Sabia, and Sofala, as well as the Rich Gold Mines supposedly found there.  In truth this area was rich in gold, in the 1300s, but by the time the Europeans arrived, most of the mines had been tapped out.   The remaining parts of the map are frequently quite vague.  Pinkerton does note several important and recognizable African tribal groups including the Bushman of the Kalahari (Booshmanas), the Hottentots, the Massai, and others.  North of the Monomotapa region we can find Lake Maravi, a long narrow lake oriented on a north-south axis.  This lake, with its northern extremis speculatively ghosted, most likely represents Lake Malawi or Lake Tanganyika, or both.    Curiously, just to the east of Maravi, Pinkerton maps an interesting apocryphal mountain range which he call the Backbone of the World.  This range has variously been associated with the Mountains of the Moon, described by the 5th century Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy, and another independent range described by Arab cartographers.  Regardless, the Backbone of the World, at least as it applies to this part of Africa, never existed.  Further north though, Pinkerton does map the Mountains of the Moon, which were said by Ptolemy to lie near two great lakes that were at the source of the White Nile.  Today some regard this range and its lakes as speculative, but more likely it represents Ptolemy's very real knowledge of Lake Victoria and the Rwenzori Mountains.  In any case Pinkerton makes the curious decision not to map the Ptolemaic Lakes, though does maintain the Mountains of the Moon, placing the source of the Nile there. To the west of the Mountains of the Moon Pinkerton draws a long mountain range called the Kong  Mountains.  This speculative was proposed by the explorations of Mungo Parks and were presumed to be the southern barrier to the Niger River valley.  All in all, this is a spectacular map that stands up to hours of close examination - a fascinating addition to any Africa collection.   Drawn by L.

De Latitude Septentrionale.,"This is a rare 1750 nautical chart of the Pacific Ocean by the French map publisher N. Bellin.  Harkens to the great age of Pacific piracy and privateering. Based on a similar chart in English prepared three years earlier by Seale. Chart depicts the trade routes used by Spanish Galleons from Acapulco, Mexico heading towards Manila in the Philippines. In particular, this chart depicts the travels of the Spanish Nostra Seigniora de Cabadonga and the British Navy Commodore George Anson.  Anson lead an ill-equipped expedition into the Pacific with the mission to attack Spanish dominions in South America. Though he failed in this mission, Anson did succeed in capturing the Spanish treasure galleon off Cape Espiritu Santo on June 20, 1743. The Spanish galleon was loaded with gold, silver and, more importantly, nautical charts depicting the trade routes used by Spanish Galleons between Mexico and Manila for the previous 200 years. This significant discovery allowed the British to disrupt Spain’s trade in the Pacific and thus economically handicap the Spanish dominance of the New World. Following his capture of the Nostra its treasures were paraded through the streets of London in no less than 32 wagons. Anson was hailed as a national hero. Beautifully details the Pacific islands including Japan, the Philippines, Guam, as well as much of the Mexican and California coast.  Names numerous important destinations along the California coast including Cabo San Lucas, San Diego, and Acapulco.  Rhumb lines throughout.   Several editions of this map were produced between 1748 and 1752.  This example is by far the most uncommon and desirable due to its superior craftsmanship, the fact that it is printed on higher quality paper, its notable wide margins, and Bellin's addition of an elaborate decorative title cartouche in the upper right quadrant.

Uncommon, highly significant, and often underappreciated, this 1854 map reveals  an important stage in the charting of the shoals off Nantucket.  Though the unpredictable waters off Nantucket were long a nemesis to sailing vessels on the important London – New York shipping routes, they had never been properly charted.  The harsh conditions, including rapid unexpected swells and frequent heavy fog, contrived to make the hydrographic survey of the hazards south of Nantucket one of the most dangerous and challenging projects of the early Coast Survey.    The first survey party to tackle this area was lead by the indomitable Lieutenant Commanding Charles H. Davis.  Starting at Old South Shoal, a known danger, Davis worked his way southward and soon discovered “New South Shoal”, which is here renamed “Davis Shoal” in his honor.  Working seasonally, it took the Coast Survey to 1853, fully seven years, to complete the survey of the Old South Shoal and Davis’ Shoal.  Bache himself discussed the difficult of accurately mapping the regions south and west of Nantucket in his 1852 Congressional Report:  The most difficult piece of hydrography on our coast has been completed during the past season. The area of broken ground east and south of the island of Nantucket is nearly seven hundred miles in extent, and is spread with dangers, some real and some only apparent. The work which has been prosecuted there perseveringly for some seasons has made the position of the dangers fully known, and has in turn employed the resources and taxed the perseverance of some of the most able hydrographers of the survey. It was commenced in 1846 by Lieut. C. H. Davis, U.S.N., has been continued since 1849 by Lieut. C. H. McBlair, and has this year been completed by Lieut. H. S. Stellwagen. The breaking of the water over these sunken shoals and banks ... which, under the name of Rips, occurs extensively over this region, serves, no doubt, to increase the terrors of the spot, though indicating in reality a change of depth, and not absolute shoalness. The outliers of this ground, Fishing Rip and Davis's Bank, have twenty-five and a half feet upon them, while on Great Rip, the Rose and Crown, Old South, and Davis's shoal, there are, respectively, but four, seven, six, and eight feet. The arrangement of these shoals led us to suppose that there must be dangers south of Davis's shoal, and several attempts have been made to look them up. The explorations of Lieutenant Commanding Stellwagen this year have completed the search over the space south of Davis's shoal to deep water, without any indication of another tier of banks. The hydrography of such ground as this is truly difficult; it must be surveyed with the minuteness of a harbor, without the facilities which neighboring land affords. The land cannot be seen from the deck of a vessel from Davis's shoal, and yet it must be traversed closely with the sounding line, and the position of the soundings be closely determined. It is necessary to establish bases from those on land by floating objects, which, like vessels, can be seen at a sufficient distance, and to preserve temporarily the positions of these floating stations by buoys. The first severe storm not only stops the actual sounding work, but is apt to break up the system entirely by removing or changing the position of these marks. The weather fit for surveying on that peculiarly stormy part of the coast is but a small fragment of each summer, and the harbors which must necessarily be sought as a refuge on the coming up of storms, which cannot be weathered in such exposed situations, are distant.",1854 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/uscs.txt,"<i>Report of the Superintendant of the United States Coast Survey,</i> Washington, (1855 edition).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NantucketShoals-uscs-1854.jpg,NantucketShoals-uscs-1854,19.5,18

The outliers of this ground, Fishing Rip and Davis's Bank, have twenty-five and a half feet upon them, while on Great Rip, the Rose and Crown, Old South, and Davis's shoal, there are, respectively, but four, seven, six, and eight feet. The arrangement of these shoals led us to suppose that there must be dangers south of Davis's shoal, and several attempts have been made to look them up. The explorations of Lieutenant Commanding Stellwagen this year have completed the search over the space south of Davis's shoal to deep water, without any indication of another tier of banks. The hydrography of such ground as this is truly difficult; it must be surveyed with the minuteness of a harbor, without the facilities which neighboring land affords. The land cannot be seen from the deck of a vessel from Davis's shoal, and yet it must be traversed closely with the sounding line, and the position of the soundings be closely determined. It is necessary to establish bases from those on land by floating objects, which, like vessels, can be seen at a sufficient distance, and to preserve temporarily the positions of these floating stations by buoys. The first severe storm not only stops the actual sounding work, but is apt to break up the system entirely by removing or changing the position of these marks. The weather fit for surveying on that peculiarly stormy part of the coast is but a small fragment of each summer, and the harbors which must necessarily be sought as a refuge on the coming up of storms, which cannot be weathered in such exposed situations, are distant.",1853 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/uscs.txt,"<i>Report of the Superintendant of the United States Coast Survey,</i> Washington, (1853 edition).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Nantucket-uscs-1853.jpg,Nantucket-uscs-1853,19.5,18

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/LongIsland-colton-1880,Antique Map: 1880 Colton Pocket Map of Long Island,Colton's New Map of Long Island.,"This is Colton's 1880 New Map of Long Island, possibly the largest and most dramatic map of Long Island to appear in the 19th century.  Covers the region from Newark, Staten Island, and New York City eastward as far as Montauk and Fisher Island.  Includes the entirety of Long Island, the Long Island Sound, and the Connecticut Coast.  A large inset in the lower right quadrant details New York City, particularly lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, Long Island City, as well as parts of Queens and Jersey City.  Colton's first forays into the mapping of Long Island began in 1855 with his introduction of the Traveler's Map of Long Island, a pocket format map designed for stage travelers and for commuters on the rapidly developing Long Island Railroad.  The construction of the LIRR, in combination with the increasingly expensive and unsanitary conditions of Manhattan, spurred massive and extensive emigration to the Island.  Around 1873, recognizing the need for a large scale high quality map of Long Island, Colton redrew his rather small Traveler's Map on a significantly larger and more dramatic scale, producing this, Colton's New Map of Long Island.   This map went through a series of editions in the subsequent years, reflecting an urgent need to keep up to date regarding the explosive growth through Long Island. In this particular edition, 1880, the western part of the Island is crisscrossed an advanced network of railways.  The Brooklyn-Montauk railroad extend eastwards as far as Patchogue, the Long Island Railroad's Sag Harbor extension has been completed, and the main line itself extends as far as Greenpoint in the North Fork.    The Hampton resort towns of Bridgehampton, Southampton, East Hampton, Amagansett, and Wainscott, all at this time sleepy fishing and farming communities, are well represented.  The earliest edition of this map was most likely 1873, though we know of no extant examples, this is the earliest extant printing we know of.  The latest known edition was printed 1890 and additional known editions were published in 1888 and 1883.   Copyrighted in 1873 by G.W. and C.B.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/UnitedStates-tallis-1851,Antique Map: 1851 Tallis and Rapkin Map of the United States,United States.,"This is a fascinating 1851 map of the United States by the English map and atlas publisher John Tallis and his engraver John Rapkin.  Covers the United States from  and Santa Fe north through the Missouri Territory to Canada and east to the Atlantic. The Trans-Mississippi region is exceptionally interesting with a fascinating (if somewhat inaccurate even at the time) depiction of the political geography.     A long Narrow Nebraska territory extends to Canada.  There is a large “Western Territory roughly where Oklahoma is today.  Probably the most interesting element of this map is its curious treatment of the New Mexico territory.  In the previous edition of this  map, 1850, the area that is here New Mexico was part of  the original Texas annexation.  New Mexico Territory was created in 1850 following U.S. acquisition of Upper California (Alta California) in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago - which ended the Mexican American War.  Curiously, though Tallis is fully appraised of these events, as exhibited by his inclusion of the newly created New Mexico Territory, he does not extend it westward beyond the Rio Grand to include its charter claims in Upper California.  Why Tallis made this decision is unclear though it may be a case of carto-advocacy in support of Mexico.  Washington and Franklin medallions decorate the right and left borders. Decorative vignettes depicts a Buffalo Hunt, Penn’s Treaty with the Indians, and the Washington Monument.

Blaeu's remarkable c. 1635 map of  the northwestern parts of South America , Lake Parima (Parime Lacus), and the route to El Dorado.  Blaeu initially issued this map in 1630 and  variants were published well in to the 1660s.  This example dates to the 1635 German edition of Blaeu's atlas.  The map covers from  Isla Margarita and the Orinoco Delta eastward as far as Tampico and southwards as far as the Amazon River.   This region of South America generated considerable European interest in the early 17th century following the publication of Sir Walter Raleigh's fascinating Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful EMPIRE Of GUIANA .   Raleigh's expedition traveled down the Orinoco River in search of the Kingdom of El Dorado.  Today we know that El Dorado did not exist, but was rather an amalgam of very real tribal traditions and the European lust for gold.   Nonetheless, in the 16th century, tales of El Dorado were common conversation along the port cities of the Spanish Main.  Having explored a considerable distance down the Orinoco, Raleigh's expedition found itself mired in a remote tribal village at the onset of the rainy season.  While waiting for an opportunity to return north, a trading delegation arrived.  At this time the dominate trading empire in the Amazon were the Manoa, who, though based near modern day Manaus, pursued trade routes to from the foothills of the Andes to the Amazon and Orinoco Deltas.   While the rainy season prevented Raleigh from moving forward, for the Manoa it had the opposite effect.  The heavy rains inundated the vast Parima flood plain creating a great inland sea, consequently opening an important trade connection between the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers.  When the Manoa arrived, Raleigh and his men noticed  that they had various golden trinkets for sale.  This was apparently enough for Raleigh to deduce that they must indeed be from the hidden kingdom of El Dorado.  When Raleigh asked where the traders came from, the locals, with no common language with which to engage Raleigh, could only explain that they traveled across a great water and were from Manoa.  Raleigh's presumptuous narrative inspired many early cartographers to map this massive lake, with the city of El Dorado or Manoa on its shores, in the unexplored lands between the Orinoco and Amazon River basins.   In addition to Blaeu's fascinating depiction of Lake Parima, among the most prominent such in any mapping of this region, there are also a number of attractive decorative elements.  Three sailing ships ply the waters and just under the compass rose a scary looking sea monster  swims toward shore.

Sanson's remarkable 1656 map of  the northwestern parts of South America , Lake Parima (Parime), and the route to El Dorado.  Cartographically this map is loosely based upon cartographic conventions established by De Laet, however, Sanson introduced some interesting new ideas, including some of the first fixed political borders in this region.  The map covers fro  Isla Margarita and the Orinoco Delta eastward as far as Tampico and southwards as far as the mouth of the Amazon River.   This part of South America generated considerable European interest in the early 17th century following the publication of Sir Walter Raleigh's fascinating Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful EMPIRE Of GUIANA .

Raleigh's presumptuous narrative inspired many early cartographers to map this massive lake, with the city of El Dorado or Manoa on its shores, in the unexplored lands between the Orinoco and Amazon River basins.   Sanson's map is also one of the first to introduce definite political boundaries to this region.  Earlier maps had several loosely established regions bounded  by mountain ranges, rivers, and other natural borders.  These included Guiana, Nueva Andalusia, and Caribana.   Sanson codifies these more firmly and made a couple of interesting innovations.  The most important is the border that follows the course of the apocryphal Wacarima mountain range (which probably refers  Raleigh's sighting of Venezuela's great Tepuis)  which runs on north-south axis east of the Orinoco.  Sanson extends the range to meet the  Orinoco at the mouth of the Delta, however, he departs from this range to extend the political border slightly to the east.  This curious decision most like refers to the point at which Spanish navigators traveling north along the Orinoco turned west, heading for the Gulf of Paria in an attempt to avoid the dangers and difficult to navigate Orinoco Delat.  In drawing this important line, Sanson sets firm limits to Spanish dominance in the region.  West of this line are the known lands of Nova Andalusia, but to the east, the indigenous Caribes, Muckikeri, and Harritianhans reign supreme.    Curiously Sanson chooses to ignore known Dutch settlements along the Surinam and Essekebe Rivers.  By leaving out the Dutch lands, Sanson may have been seeking favor with the French crown.",1656 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sanson.txt,"Mariette, P. and Sanson, N, <i>Cartes Generales De La Geographie Ancienne et Nouvelle Ou Les Empires, Monarchies, Royaums</i>, 2 vols, c. 1660.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Guiane-sanson-1656.jpg,Guiane-sanson-1656,21.5,16
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/CarolinaGeorgia-bowen-1747,"Antique Map: 1747 Bowen Map of the Southeastern United States (Carolina, Georgia, Florida)",A New & Accurate Map of the Provinces of North &  South Carolina & c.,"This is Emmanuel Bowen's remarkable 1747 chart of the southeastern parts of North America.  Covers from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay to St. Augustine, FL, and from Louisiana to the Atlantic.  Introduced in the second edition of Bowen's important  Complete System of Geography , this map is loosely based on the cartographic conventions established by Popple's seminal 1733 map of the British Empire in America.  Though Popple's map covered most of the continent, Bowen narrows his focus to the interesting area is today the American Southeast.    The colonial boundaries of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina and Florida are clearly demarcated but, upon close examination, somewhat ambiguous in form.  The coast lands, particularly in the Carolinas are well settled and exhibit considerable European development, however, only a short distance inland European settlements quickly give way to unexplored lands and the territories claimed by powerful American Indian nations.  It is no mistake that Bowen chooses to include significant portions of both Spanish controlled Florida and French controlled Louisiana in the extreme southern and western parts of his maps.  The French and Spanish had long been considered a serious threat to British hegemony in this region.   In response to French incursions out of Louisiana the British forged a number of alliances with various indigenous groups, most specifically a 1745 treaty with the Cherokee and Catawaa tribes in what is today Kentucky and Tennessee.  This alliance, of which Bowen makes a large notation in the center of his map, created a critical buffer zone between the French and British Empires in America.  At the same time it opened Cherokee lands to British merchants and traders, as is evidenced by several English factories and forts appearing in the Cherokee dominated portion of what is ostensibly French Louisiana. Even so,  it was from the south and the great Spanish bastion of St. Augustine that the British in America felt the greatest threat.   It was partially in response to this and the need to develop the southern portions of Britian's American holdings, that lead to the founding of the Georgia colony in 1733.  Just thirteen years after its founding in Savannah, we see the Georgia colony well defended through a series of fortifications and towns both along the coast and dotting the inland river ways.  South of the border, in Florida, the Okefenokee Swamp separates Spanish and British dominions.   Here two we can read a clear differentiation in colonizing philosophy.  Where the British rely on treaties, settlement, and commercial development to further their interest in American Indian held lands, the Spanish dot the countryside with missions.  In the northern part of Florida alone seven missions are identified:  St. Francisco, St. Peter, St Mathew, St. John, St. Paul and St. Mark.  All and all, this is an extraordinarily interesting and essential map for any serious collection focusing on the American Southwest.

S. Coast Survey, 1859.  Oriented to the west, this map depicts the immediate city of San Francisco and surrounding areas as far as the Mission de Dolores and Rancho San Miguel.  The chart was issued about ten years following the population explosion brought on by the 1849 gold Rush.  Depicts the city extending only about eleven city blocks from the waterfront.  Labels piers, wharfs, parks and roads as well as indicating important individual buildings such as the City Hall, the Post Office, hospitals, and churches.  The Bay features detailed depth soundings.    Text on public buildings, reservoirs, sailing notes, shoals, and tidal notations are included on the top left and lower right hand corners of the map.   The work of the coast survey around the city of San Francisco was completed in 1852 and first known U.S. C. S. plan of the city and its immediate vicinity was published in the same year.  Rumsey suggests that the actual city plan was taken from an earlier map produced Cook and Le Count, and  Vogdes suggests that the interior topography is drawn from the Eddy's official map of San Francisco.  This first Coast Survey Chart of San Francisco was oriented to the north and covered a considerably small area than the map offered here.   The above chart was issued in 1857 to replace the 1853 chart and account for the rapid urbanization of the San Francisco vicinity.  Although much of the actual topography is based on the original 1853 map, there are a number of important updates and expansions, especially in the extreme eastern and southern quadrants.  The notation of the Union Race Course, the Pioneer Race Course, the Road to San Jose, and the Rancho de San Miguel are but a few such additions.   Furthermore, this map also features the addition of a Table of References to the right of the main map.  This numbered table identifies a number of important buildings throughout the city including churches, theaters, hotels, fire houses, hospitals and government buildings.

Magnetic Declination, or as it is more commonly known Magnetic Variance, refers to the difference between true north and compass north.

Today the magnetic variance in Florida is 0 degrees, but when this chart was made in 1870, the 0 degree point was in South Carolina.  A cartographer traveling north from South Carolina to Maine would find that his compass miscalculated north by nearly 18 degrees!  In other places the variance is even more extreme.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NansenBushu-hotan-1710,"Antique Map: 1710 First Japanese Buddhist Map of the World Showing Europe, America,  and Africa",Nansenbushu Bankoku Shoka No Zu  (Outline Map of All Countries of the Universe),"A seminal map. This is the first Japanese printed map to depict the world, including Europe and America, from a Buddhist cosmographical  perspective.   Printed by woodblock in 1710 (Hoei  7), this map was composed by the Buddhist monk Rokashi Hotan.  Inspired by the 1653 publication of  Si-yu-ki, a pilgrimage narrative of the Chinese monk Hsuang-Tsang's (602-604) travels to India  in search of sacred Sanskrit writings,  Rokashi Hotan's map attempts to update Buddhist mythological cartography, as exemplified in the 1634 manuscript map Gotenjikuzu (Map of the Five Regions of India), to correspond with the Si-yu-ki, as well as with contemporary and ancient religious texts, Chinese annals, travel narratives, and even some European maps.   Rokashi Hotan lists these texts, 102 in all, at the top of the map.  The consequent product of Rokashi Hotan's work is this magnificent amalgam of disparate ideas and traditions.    In essence this is a traditional Buddhist world view in the Gotenjikuzu mold centered on the world spanning continent of Jambu-Dvipa.  At its center is Lake Anavatapta, a whirlpool-like quadruple helix lake believed to be the center of the universe.    This lake, which is commonly associated with Lake Manasarovar in northern India, is believed in Buddhist mythology to be the legendary site where  Queen Maya conceived the Buddha.  From the quadrouple beast headed helix (heads of a horse, a lion, an elephant, and an ox) of  Manasarovar  or Lake Anavatapta  radiate the four sacred rivers of the region: the Indus, the Ganges, the Bramaputra, and the Sutlej.   South of Jambu-Dvipa,  India is recognizable for in its peninsular form.  Japan itself appears as a series of Islands in the upper right and, like India, is one of the few recognizable elements - at least from a cartographic perspective.  China  and Korea appear to the west of Japan and are vaguely identifiable geographically, which itself represents a significant advancement over the Gotenjikuzu map.  Southeast Asia also makes  one of its first appearances in a Japanese Buddhist map as an island cluster to the east of India.   On the opposite side of the map a series of islands is intended to represent Europe, which had no place at all in earlier Buddhist world maps, making this one of the first Japanese maps to depict Europe.  Umukari (Hungary), Oranda, Baratan, Komo (Holland or the country of the red hair), Arubaniya (Albania?), Itarya (Italy), Suransa (France) and Inkeresu (England) are all named.    Africa appears as a small island in the western sea identified as the Land of Western Women.   Of special note is Rokashi Hotan's mapping of the Americas.  Prior to this map America had rarely if ever been depicted on Japanese maps, so Rokashi Hotan turned to the Chinese map Daimin Kyuhen Zu (Map of China under the Ming Dynasty and its surrounding Countries), from which he copied both the small island-like form of  South America (just south of Japan), and the curious land bridge (the Aelutian Islands?) connecting Asia to what the Japanese historians Nobuo Muroga and Kazutaka Unno conclude must undoubtedly be a reflection of North America (page 63).  Whether this represents ancient knowledge from early Chinese navigations in this region, for which there is some literary if not historical evidence, or merely a printing error, we can only speculate.   While this map represents a significant step forward in the Japanese attempt to combine religious and contemporary geographic knowledge it remains in essence a Buddhist map.  It is likely that Rokashi Hotan was aware important European style maps circulating in China at the time.  The Mateo Ricci Map is one such example and copies were known to have reached Japan in the 17th century. It is curious that Rokashi Hotan chose to ignore it and other Eurocentric data in exchange for a religious world view, while at the same time attempting to reconcile Buddhist and modern geography.",1710 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/rokashihotan.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NansenBushu-hotan-1710.jpg,NansenBushu-hotan-1710,56.5,45

According to ye newest and most exact observations, by Herman Moll, Geographer.","One of the most remarkable and intriguing maps of the  West Indies to appear in the 18th century.  This is Herman Moll's superb circa 1720 mapping of the West Indies, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, and the Spanish Main.   Monumental in proportion, rich in descriptive text, and exhaustive it its attention to detail, this map is best understood as a guide to English piracy and privateering in the West Indies.   Moll, most likely through his acquaintance with pirates William Dampier and Woodes Rogers, offers a wealth of information on the traffic of silver bearing Spanish treasure fleets  en route  from the Mexican port of Veracruz, through the islands, to Spanish ports in Europe.    Following the dotted line, Moll identifies the Spanish treasure fleet's  entrada  into the Caribbean via the passage between Granada and Trinidad.  The fleet then sailed westwards, skirting the Spanish Main until they reached Cartagena, where they rested and reprovisioned before heading northwards, rounding western Cuba and stopping in Havana.  Using the strong Gulf Stream current - shown here - ships would sail northwards from Havana while being steadily forced to the southeast thus alighting at the deep water port of Veracruz.  On the return, laden with silver from the mines of San Luis Potosi, the Spanish fleet took advantage of eastward blowing trade winds, which helped to overcome the strong current on the sail to Havana.   From Havana they would travel northwards via the narrow passage between Florida and the Bahamas before cutting eastward and out to sea at St. Augustine.  It was here, in this crucial passage between the English dominated Bahamas and Spanish Florida, that the most nefarious pirates lay in wait for their prey.   In addition to descriptions of the sailing routes and currents, Moll provides insets of five important Spanish ports, including St. Augustine, Veracruz, Havana, Porto Bella, and Cartagena.   As privateer fleets grew in strength and number in the early 18th century full scale assaults on major ports became increasingly common.  Moll's choice of these key treasure ports leaves little doubt regarding his intentions and sources.   Moll further fills this marvelous map with numerous notations that, while bearing no direct impact on piracy in the region, do offer considerable insight into his political persuasions.  He identifies, for example the river route through Tabasco and Chiapas, via which supplies and cannons were transported to the important Pacific port of Acapulco.  He also notes the Spanish fort of Pensacola where all their Indians have Deserted and gone to ye French at Mobile.   Just to the east of this, in northern Florida, he identifies the land of the Apalache, once a powerful Indian empire which by Moll's time had all but vanished.  This area was attacked and, according to Moll, brought over to English rule by the governor of South Carolina, James Moore, in 1704.   In a few areas he also comments on some of the produce and mineral richness of the land, identifying the Silver Mines of Coahuila, the American Indian horseman of the Great Plains, Cacao Plantations in Costa Rica, sources of indigo, cochineal, and silvester in the mountains of Guatemala, and the great number of Breeves in Cuba and Texas.  Breeves,  curiously, were a kind of wild Spanish bovine that later evolved into the Texas Longhorn.  Cartographically this map does offer a few interesting innovations.  These include Moll's careful and accurate depiction of the Gulf Stream current as well as his orientation of Florida's St. John's River (St.  Whan's R).  This is the first map since  the 16th century Le Moyne map to correctly plot the St. John's river running south from its  entrada  north of St. Augustine.   Earlier maps plotted the river running northwest into the great lake of Apalache - an error dating to Mercator's faulty 1608 mapping of the region.",c. 1720 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/moll.txt,"Moll, H., <i>A New and Complete Atlas</i>, c. 1720.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/WestIndies-moll-1720.jpg,WestIndies-moll-1720,40,24

Levasseur depicts the world on a Mercator Projection, showing the six known continents as well as traces of Antarctica.    The cartographic style of this piece is minimalist, but a few elements do bear special note.  These include the extension of Oregon territory well into British Columbia, reflecting the American claims that later led to the 54 40' dispute.  Also in North America, Texas is identified as an independent nation.  Far to the north both the Northwest Passage over America and the Northeast Passage over Europe and Asia, are drawn as open and practically navigable waterways.   By far this map's most striking feature is its elaborate allegorical border work.  Levasseur composed this map for publication in his magnificent  Atlas Nacionale de la France Illustree , one of the most decorative and beautifully produced atlases to appear in the 19th century.   This particular map is surrounded by four medallions bearing allegorical representation of each season.  Spring, in the upper left, is represented by a young unclothed woman modestly covering herself with garlands.  Summer, in the lower right, is a powerful bearded man wearing an animal skin and surrounded by the bounty of life. Fall, upper right, is a young man reaping the harvest.  And winter, lower left, is a huddled old woman in a barren snow covered setting.    Atop the map is an image of the firmament, with shooting starts, clouds, and a symbolic representation of the Zodiac.  At center is a curious unclothed women with four breasts who appears to be chained to the earth or to a heavy box which she is holding - Pandora?  Adam and Eve appear to her right walking hand in hand through pre-fall Eden.  There too is the serpent, slithering just behind the couple.    At the base of the map an even more interesting scene unfolds in the form of a curious panorama.  Here Jesus sits enthroned, bearing a cross in his left hand and pointing with his right, his head surrounded by a pyramid (a Masonic reference?).  To his left are a stoic crowd including Napoleon, Socrates, and other unidentifiable great men bearing signs reading Paix (peace), Liber (freedom), and Egalite (equality).  Behind them is a domed building that appears to be a Greek or Roman temple.  Opposite this scene, on Jesus' right is a very different scene showing a crowd fleeing in terror - these include a Pharisee holding the Torah and a turbaned Saracen. Behind them are the pyramids of Egypt.  They are running towards what appears to be the jungle in the midst of which is a plinth upon which sets a bust of Satan.  In this we can only assume that Levasseur is attempting to convey the righteousness of reason and logic over emotion and old world superstition. Publised by V.

In 1874 one thousand cavalrymen under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer moved into the Black Hills region of Dakota Territory.  Though officially American Indian territory according to the 1868 Treaty of Laramie, rumors had been circulating since the early 19th century that this region harbored rich deposits of gold.  Custer and his men were sent to investigate.  With Custer was William Ludlow, an officer of the Army Corps of Engineers ( inheritor of the legacy left by the Topographical Engineers ) whose commission was to explore and survey the region, identifying in the process if the rumored gold did indeed exist.    Ludlow and Custer traveled west from Fort Lincoln on the Missouri River (near Bismarck) to the Powder River, thence north and South into the Black Hills.   Their path, many camp sites, and survey triangulation points are documented throughout.   Ludlow compounded his work by attaching it to pre-existing exploratory survey work performed by Reynolds in 1859-60, Warren in 1857, and Sully in 1864, and to the Northern Pacific Railroad Surveys performed in 1871 and 1872, all of which are noted.   As a whole this map is full of fascinating detail, which lead map historian C. I. Wheat to call it a most interesting map.  Throughout Ludlow offers commentary on the territory such as High hills heavily timbered Water and grass abundant, grass and water good, bad lands and soil and loose dry clay.  In addition to his scientific and geological notations, Ludlow also offers some interesting historical commentary such identifying the site where they killed the Rees and where the sick man was killed.  these both possibly reference events on the 1871 Pacific Railroad Survey wherein friendly Indian guides of the Rees tribe were killed by raiding Sioux.   Ultimately, Custer and his men did find gold in the Black Hills, leading to the 1876 Black Hills Gold Rush. Completely disregarding the Treaty of Laramie, gold hungry settlers rushed into the region, coming into immediate conflict with  the warlike Sioux.  Custer's foolish attack on the Sioux encampment and the subsequent massacre at Little Big Horn were a direct result of this conflict.  Ultimately the Black Hills Gold discovery turned out to be one of the greatest gold strikes in history, producing 10% of the world's gold supply for the next 125 years.

This particular map was drawn by  Hyannis architect Walter M. Gaffney during the Great Depression.  According to his daughter, Gaffney issued this map to make supplemental money while the architecture business suffered a downturn.  This is considered a figurative map or a decorative map, and reflects a style that first began to appear around 1910.  As a map its intention is not so much to provide direction as to illustrate the character, famous places, and historical appeal of Cape Cod.  Cartographically speaking, this map style most likely draws its inspiration from late 19th century tourist maps and railroad maps.  Tourist Maps,  common to major cities in Europe (usually Paris or London), included profiles of notable buildings and monuments and were designed to help foreign tourists identify and navigate to the most important sights.  Railroad Maps are a related genre more common to the United States.  During the later part of the 19th century railroad boom, railroad companies began issuing decorative route maps extolling the virtues various regions and their accessibility by rail.

Surrounding the map are ten medallions intended to represent life in Asia - though most of the these seem to focus on India, at the time the most known of Asian lands.  To the left of the map proper is an enthroned woman, a most likely representation of Hesione, the wife of Prometheus, who is commonly associated with Asia. Curiously the figure holds a  main de justice , a kind of scepter with a hand of benediction on top, it her right hand.  The  main de justice  was initially a symbol of royal French power and in this case is a possible reference to the French claims to Indochina.  Right of the map Adam and Eve are drawn relaxing in Eden, with a benevolent God figure looking on.  As with most Levasseur depictions of god, his halo is pyramidal, a possibly Masonic reference.  Levassuer's choice to add Adam and Eve to this map is a reference to mediaeval beliefs that Eden lay in the seas beyond Asia.  Various exotic animals including a bear, a buffalo, an rhino, a tiger, and an crocodile appear at the bottom of the map.   Publised by V.

Comparative mountains charts first appeared in the late 18th and early 19th century.  Initially these charts focused on Europe or even signal countries, but by the early 19th century the explorations of the world's great peaks had reached a point where such a chart could be composed on a global level.  John Thompson, the preeminent Scottish cartographer of the period, introduced this chart, one of the first and most interesting of the genre.  Covering both the eastern and western hemispheres, this chart shows not only the heights of mountains, but also compares them to important buildings, cities, vegetation limits, and even fauna.   Thompson divides his map in to the western hemisphere, on the left, and the eastern hemisphere on the right.  In the Western Hemisphere, he identifies the Ecuadorian peak of Chimborazo at the highest mountains - the great Chilean peaks had not yet been discovered.  Just below the summit of Chimborazo, a tiny speck represents a rare Andean Condor in flight with a highest altitude of 21,000 feet.  About halfway down on the left side of Chimborazo, another little speck, this time in the shape of a man, indicated the highest elevation attained by the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.    Also identified are various high evolution towns and cities including Mexico City, Lake Toluca, Quito, and Caracas, among others.  On the right hand side of Thompson's map chart, the behemoths of the Eastern Hemisphere dwarf the mountains of the west.  Here, Nepal's Dhaulagiri, 27,677 feet, is identified as the world's greatest mountain.  Everest and many of the other great Himalayan peaks had not yet been discovered - today we know that Dhaulagiri, though certainly a mighty peak, is only 8th.  Engraved by the firm of W. and D. Lizars for John Thomson's 1817 edition of  Thomson's New General Atlas .",1817 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/thomson.txt,"Thomson, J.,  <i>Thomson's New General Atlas</i>, 1817.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/ComparativeMountains-thomson-1817.jpg,ComparativeMountains-thomson-1817,25.5,20

Covering the viceroyalty granted to Hernan Cortez following his conquest of the Aztec Empire, this map details, roughly, from  Mexico City westward to the Pacific coast and northward as far as modern day Michoacán.  Cartographically Mercator's map is heavily influenced by Ortelius' 1579 map of the same region.  Though we are uncertain of Ortelius' sources, this map exhibits a combination of known and speculative cartographic elements.  Mexico City appears at right center surrounded by water as it appeared at the time of the conquest.  By the time this map was drawn, much of the region between Mexico City and the Pacific ports along the coast, as well as the mining regions to the north and west, had been roughly mapped by the conquistadores.  Lake Chapala (Chapalicum Mare) for example is accurately situated and formed.  However, as the map extends further north into only tenuously explored regions, the cartography becomes more speculative.  The large inland sea in the northwestern quadrant with is four numbered and named islands is clearly drawn from indigenous legends, most likely as transmitted via the Codex Mendoza.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Amerique-desnos-1760,Antique Map: 1760 Desnos and De La Tour Map of North America and South America,Amerique.,"This is an extremely rare example of Desnos and Brion de la Tour's c. 1760 mapping of America.  Covers both North America and South America from Greenland to Cape Horn.  Overall the general form of the continents exhibit an craggy and exceptionally rugged coast line - a step back from some more advanced maps of this region available at the time.  The cartography of North America, particularly the pre-Cook northwest is speculative and indistinct.   The cartographer hints at a Northwest Passage via the lake and river systems extending westward from the St. Lawrence, through the Great Lakes, to Lake Winnipeg and the Lake of the Woods.   Though the westwards passage is  incomplete, a suggestive open inlet does appear just north of Cape Mendocino.   This variant on the Northwest Passage was the great unrealized hope of the French Empire in North America, who unlike the Spanish to the south, had no easy access to the trade riches of the Pacific.   Identifies the English colonies along the East Coast, in Newfoundland, and around the Hudson Bay.   Spanish holdings in Mexico and Florida are also noted.  Here the cartographer, a Frenchman, has exaggerated the extent of French Louisiana.   A clear case of carto-advocacy and pandering to a constituency.   In South America the interior is even more vaguely mapped than in North America.  The Orinoco, Amazon and La Plata river systems penetrate deeply into the continent, but exhibit none of the vast network of tributaries for which they are best known.  The Rio de La Plata terminates at the Lac Xarayes, a mythical lake often associated with legends of the Earthly Paradise and El Dorado, but in fact simply a misinterpretation of the Pantanal during its annual inundation.   To the left and right of the map are statistical tables and French language descriptions of  the continents.  Surrounding the whole is an elaborate decorative border featuring floral arrangements, surveying tools, elaborate baroque scalloping, and a winged globe. This example comes from an exceptionally rare side bound edition of this atlas, consequently there is no centerfold.",c. 1760 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/delatour.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Amerique-desnos-1760.jpg,Amerique-desnos-1760,21,14.5

Covering from the Chesapeake Bay to Lake Champlain and from Lake Ontario to Nova Scotia, this remarkable map is an excellent example of both the success and failures of 18th century English mapping in the American colonies.   It also makes evident the challenges of the European map publisher in piecing together  numerous disparate reports and mappings into a single cohesive cartographic entity.    In this example, the contrast  is most strikingly elucidated in Bowen's relatively accurate mapping of the coast lines in contrast to the extraordinary vagueness of the interior.   A simple overlay with a modern map reveals that while Bowen's longitudinal cartography along the coastline is slightly off from Cape Cod westward, his latitudinal reference points are dead on.   Heading inland from the Atlantic, this precision quickly evaporates.   Lake Ontario is proportionally massive and situated several hundred miles too far east.  Despite Bowen's considerable errors in proportion and positioning , the Lake Ontario shoreline is surprisingly accurate in form and detailed down to the Finger Lakes extending south from the main body.    Politically, Bowen offers some interesting detail regarding the early boundary lines of the colonies.  New Jersey in divided into the provinces of East and West Jersey.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Mexique-humboldt-1811,"Antique Map: 1811 Humboldt Map of Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida",Carte Du Mexique et des Pays Limitrophes Situes Au Nord et a l'est Dressee d'apres la Grande Carte de la Nouvelle Espagne De Mr. A. De Humboldt et d'autres Materiaux par J.B. Poirson.,"A seminal 1811 map of Mexico and the American West by Alexander von Humboldt.  Humboldt, who during his lifetime was considered the world's greatest living man, composed this map during his 1803 sojourn in Mexico.   Though often playing second fiddle to Humboldt's more regional  Carte Generale du Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne , published in the same volume, this map is a cartographic achievement in its own right and, as Wheat notes An Important Map.  Covering from California to Connecticut and from the Great Salt Lake (here Timpanagos) to Honduras, this extraordinary map not only includes most of the important cartographic innovations introduced in  Carte Generale du Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne , it also frames this information in context with much of the territory that in the coming years would be subsumed into the expanding United States.    Humboldt spent part of 1803 and 1804 living in Mexico City as a guest of the Spanish Crown.   As such he had access to rarely seen explorer's accounts and earlier mappings available in the Mexico City archives.  These he combined with information from his own travels and explorations, as well as indigenous cartographic traditions and his own theoretical understanding of geography,  to create this landmark mapping of the American southwest - the most sophisticated and advanced treatment of the region yet seen.    Among the significant advancements apparent on this map are Humboldt's connection of  Fiedler and Mackenzie's Stoney Mountains, today the Rocky Mountains, with the Cordilleras of Mexico.   Humboldt also correctly maps the course of the Rio Gila as is passes north and west of Tubscon (Tuscon).  To the east of the Rocky Mountains,  a burst of remarkable insight enables Humboldt to correctly unite the Nepeste  and Arkansas Rivers.   The Great Plains Humboldt curiously associates with Cibola, one of the seven legendary cities of gold,  but in actuality a former Hopi settlement in modern day New Mexico.  Humboldt was a great fan in indigenous cartographic knowledge, which he incorporates here with regard to the Aztec migration myth of Lake Teguayo - which he associates with Lake Timpanagos or Great Salt Lake.  The is a common though likely erroneous connection which Humboldt was not the first to make.  For the remainder of the map Humboldt draws on a number of sources including the Meria-Escalante expedition (west of the Rocky Mountains), accounts of the voyages of the ships  Sutil,  and  Mexicana  (Pacific Coast), the memoir of M. Espinsoa (Pacific Coast), the Lafond map (Louisiana), and the Arrowsmith map (United States).    Humboldt's extraordinary cartographic work would remain the authorities document on this region until advanced by the expeditions of Fremont, himself an acknowledged Humboldtian, in the late 1840s.   For his efforts Humboldt was awarded with honorary Mexican citizenship, which he retained until his death at 87. However, had the Mexican officials who applauded Humboldt seen how his mappings would influence the future shape of their nation, they may have been less than pleased.  In May of 1804, Humboldt sailed into Philadelphia.  There he befriended Jefferson, Madison, Peale, and other post-colonial American luminaries.  Believing in the free and open exchange of scientific data, Humboldt freely shared manuscript copies of his mappings of the American southwest.   Shortly before the official 1811 publication of Humboldt's important maps, the priest Hildago shouted the historic 1810  Grito de la Independencia , beginning the Mexican War of Independence.    The events that followed led directly to the Texas Revolution and the Mexican American War.  Humboldt's masterful mappings of the region - of which this is one - gave the United States crucial intelligence that would eventually lead to the U.S.",1811 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/humboldt.txt,"Humboldt, A. von, <i>Atlas Geographique Et Physique Du Royaume De La Nouvelle-Espagne, Fonde Sur Des Observations Astronomiques, Des Mesures Trigonometriques Et Des Nivellemens Barometriques, </i> 1811 (First French Edition).",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Mexique-humboldt-1811.jpg,Mexique-humboldt-1811,30,18

This war, started by Gustav X of Sweden on the pretext of rebuffing Polish claims to the Swedish crown, was in reality an attempt to assert control of trade in the Baltic.  The city of Krakow eventually fell and the Polish King fled only to regain control of his nation a few years later.

During the American Civil War this was a critical artery, the control of which would profoundly influence the course of the war.  The cartographers of the United States Coast Survey, most of whom where Union men, understood that a proper mapping of the region was essential to control of the River.  Gerdes spent part of 1864 preparing this map set for use by the Mississippi River Squadron, a flotilla of ironclads that would play a role in several important Civil War battles.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that Squadron ever actually saw these charts as it was disbanded in 1865, the same year the chart set was competed.

Covers the island in full as well as adjacent parts of Sumatra and Bali.  Offers beautiful engraving and extraordinary detail throughout, noting rice plantations, mountain ranges, grazing lands, forests, and in many places, elephants and gazelle.  The previously unknown southern shore is mapped both correctly and in considerable detail.  Also  shows some offshore reefs and other dangers.  The volcanic island of Krakatau, here identified as Cracatao, which nearly 150 years later would erupt with devastating consequences, appears in the Strait of Sunda between Java and Sumatra. In the lower left quadrant an inset details the city and port of Batavia, then the center of Dutch East Indian Company's activity in the region.  Appearing in tapestry style windows at the top of the map is an area of extensive text. Composed by Gueudeville, this is a discussion of the history of the lands and countries depicted.  Additional textual data referencing the cities and villages of Java, appears to the left and right of the map proper.  In its day Chatelain's map of Java was by far the most sophisticated study of the island yet published. Previous to this map, the most advanced cartographic rendering of Java was Van der Aa's 1714 mapping of the region, which though it correctly identified general form of Java's northern shore, identified the southern shore as Parte Incognita.  Of course the Dutch were active in this region since the 17th century and had no doubt produced accurate manuscript charts of the island, but these were carefully guarded trade secrets controlled by the powerful  Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie  (V.O.C. or Dutch East India Company).  The publication of Chatelain's map of Java, offered here, suggests that Chatelain somehow obtained his data from a source outside of the V.O.C.  That Chatelain's map was copied by Johannes Van Keulen II, the V.O.C.'s own cartographer, nine years later suggests that even the V.O.C., who maintained an active presence on the island, did not possess more accurate data. It is highly likely that Chatelain extracted much of his cartographic information on Java from Hadrien Reland, a Dutch scholar and philologist who composed a number of works on the Indonesian Archipelago in the early 18th century.    A highly important map of the region and a must for an serious collection focusing on the East Indies.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/UnitedStates-burr-1839,Antique Map: 1839 Burr Wall Map of the United States (only example of Jedediah Smith's map),Map of the United States Of North America With parts of the Adjacent Countries.,"This is David H.  Burr's all but unobtainable 1839 wall map of the United States.  Burr's map is an accomplishment of staggering significance and is considered the culmination of one of the  most dramatic and romantic periods in the mapping of the American West.  It is further one of the most significant maps in the opening of the American West to the Gold Rush that, in just a few years, would transform the nation.  Between the expedition of Louis and Clark in 1804 - 1806 and the work of Fremont in the 1840s, the exploration of the Transmississippi experienced a kind of dark age.  Nevertheless, while no official teams were pushing cartography westward,  trappers and fur traders were slowly penetrating the region.  Most of these figures were illiterate and did little to extend cartographic knowledge.  The exception was Jedediah Smith, a trapper whose wanderings in the west and subsequent cartographic innovations the historian C. I.  Wheat considers a  tour-de-force  unprecedented and never equaled in the annals of Western exploration.  Smith spent roughly 9 years, between 1821 and 1830, exploring the Great Basin, the Sierra Nevada, the Rocky Mountains and the valleys of California, but sadly perished before his important work could be published.  Smith's now lost map was taken by his partner and friend, Missouri Congressman William H. Ashely, and eventually made its way into the hands of David H. Burr, who was then composing his own important map of the United States - offered here.  Smith's work must have seemed a revelation to Burr who struggled to reconcile conflicts between the mappings of Humboldt, Pike, Miera, and of course, Lewis and Clark.   Burr, realizing the importance of Smith's work, incorporated it throughout his map, thus redefining the cartographic representation of the region.  Shortly after Burr published this seminal map, Smith's original manuscript was lost, making Burr's map the sole printed representation of Smith's work.  Curiously and somewhat inexplicably, this map never attained significant popularity in its day, leading to a very small publication run and, today, extreme rarity.     Our survey of Burr's map must begin in the east.  Burr, having just competed individual state plates for the 1835 issue of his  New Universal Atlas  had a relatively easy task of assembling the individual mappings into a cohesive whole.  However, several elements do bear note.   Burr identifies the nation's fledgling rail network, which is strongest in the northeast, with bold blue and red lines.  In the state of Maine both the disputed British boundary, roughly along the 47th parallel, and the far northern boundary claimed by the state of Maine are noted.  Heading west the territory becomes less settled and the character of the map changes.  Particularly in Wisconsin and what would soon become Iowa, towns are few and far between, instead the map shifts its focus to notating American Indian Nations as well as the locations of forts, mills, lakes, portages, rapids, and waterfalls.  Several land exchanges and treaties with various American Indian groups including the Sioux, the Sacs and Foxes, and the Chippewa are also identified.   When Burr drew this map, Missouri was the westernmost state and the jumping point for most significant journeys westward.  Beyond the borders of Missouri the territory is dominated by the American Indian Nations recently relocated to western lands by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.  These includes the Osages, Cherokee, Creek and Choctaw.  Further north the territories of the Otoes, Kansas, and Shawnees are noted.   The map also identifies important landmarks on the route westward including the fur trapping forts on the Arkansas River (Gant and Bent), various springs, Pikes Peak, James Peak, and the Spanish Peaks.  Where known military routes through the region are sketched in, including Major Long's Route and more importantly the Route of the Dragoons under Col.",1839 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/burr.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/UnitedStates-burr-1839.jpg,UnitedStates-burr-1839,51,38

This extraordinary chart is considered the highest expression of the mountains and rivers convention as developed in the 19th century.  No mountains and rivers chart before or after presents such a vast, detailed, and beautifully rendered tableau.  Though roughly based upon Bulla's 1826  Tableau Comparatif , Andriveau and Goujon here develop the comparative mountains and rivers chart considerably by adding numerous topographical and geological notations, updating the older chart with regard to new information, redrawing the waterfalls section, incorporating textual data to either side of the chart proper, and adding a sub sea level element. Even the ballooning feat of Gay-Lussac who attained an altitude of 7000 meters in 1808 is noted.   The comparative mountains section, occupying the lower right half of this chart, details the principle mountains of the world.  Ranges are color  coded to show different types of vegetation and numerically reference tables to the left and right of the chart proper.  The elevation of a number of important cities including Paris, Rome, London, Geneva, Mexico, Bogota, and Quito, among others, is noted.    There are also extensive notations on vegetation, volcanic activity, and lichen, much of which is no doubt influenced by Humboldt.  The Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri is identified as the world's greatest mountain. A waterfall chart occupies the extreme bottom right with the Pyrenean waterfall of Gavarnie identified as the world's highest.  The upper left portion of this chart is dominated by the world's greatest rivers.  Andriveau and Goujon attempt not only to express the lengths of the various rivers, but also details regarding their course and sources.  All along each river important lakes, cities, directions, and distance measurements are noted.  Here the Amazon is identified as the world's greatest river at 1507 km, followed by the Mississippi at 1687 km.  The Nile comes up a sad third at 1611 km even though its full length had yet to be explored.

A fine example of Homann's work, this map bears all of the distinctive hallmarks of Homann's style at the height of his career: a strong dark impression, heavy yet detailed engraving work, elaborate allegorical title cartouches, and a rich but tasteful application of color.    The prototype of this map was drawn in 1689 by the Amsterdam cartographer Nicholas Visscher II, who Homann credits in the title cartouche.  Visscher's map became the model for most future maps of Ireland well into the late 18th century.  Homann revised and updated this map to reflect early 18th  century changes to the island.   Here Ireland is divided into its four provinces, Munster, Connought (Connacht), Leinster (Lenister) and Ulster, then subdivided into numerous counties.  Roads, mountains, forests, swamps, rivers, lakes, bridges towns, and even some offshore details are noted.  The elaborate title cartouche in the upper right is rich with Gaelic iconography, including the Gaelic Harp and allegorical representations of Pan, a Celtic adaptation of the Roman god Bacchus, and Brigit, the Celtic goddess of poetry, healing and agriculture.   Another cartouche in the lower right hand quadrant frames the map's key and four distance scales.  Here we see four fisherman pulling in the day's haul, a clear nod to Visscher, who's Dutch name translates to Fisherman.  Above the map key itself is the royal crest of the United Kingdom, who at the time laid claim to Ireland. This map was published in various editions from about 1710 to 1750.  The addition of Homann's Privilege to the title cartouche suggest this may be the second state of this map, published sometime between 1715 and Homann's death in 1720.

This map, from Keur's important Dutch Bible of 1702,  is oriented to west and covers from the Nile Delta, Cairo and Memphis, Egypt, across the Red Sea and along the Mediterranean Coast as far north as Sidon and Tyre (Lebanon), and further inland, Palmyra.  Cartographically this map hails from the Nicholas Visscher map of 1650, but it does exhibit some modifications including completely revised topical imagery in the lower quadrants.   Like Visscher's map, our map shows the course of the Israelites as they fled out of Egypt, across the Red Sea, and subsequently spent the next forty years wandering in the Sinai before migrating into the Promised Land by crossing the Jordan river just north of the Dead Sea.  Mt. Sinai, Mt. Horeb, Sodom, Gomorra, Jerusalem, and countless other importable Biblical locals are noted.

Woolworth Colton's 1866 vertical map of New York.  This important map, based on a pocket map of the same area issued in 1865, marks a significant rethinking of the standard Manhattan map. Previous maps of New York City tended to represent only the lower parts of Manhattan (on the Burr model) or orient the city horizontally with the top of the map facing west (as in the Commissioner's Plan).  With the opening of Central Park in the mid 1860s, the previously rural northern portions of the city became not only accessible, but desirable destinations.  Map publishers of the period, most notably Colton and Johnson, were forced to reconsider their mappings in order to more properly locate Central Park and its environs in the heart of New York City.  This pocket map was most likely initially issued in 1865 as a prototype to test the new map before it was included in the Colton's Atlas of 1866.  Johnson began including a very similar map,  with slight modifications, in his atlas starting in 1867.  The map itself is oriented to the north and covers Manhattan Island from  Battery Park to 125th Street.  Also covered are adjacent portions of Brooklyn (Williamsburg and Greenpoint), Queens (Long Island City, Hunter's Point, Ravenswood, and Astoria),Jersey City and Hoboken. Central Park is shown in full with excellent interior detail.  An inset in the upper left quadrant details upper Manhattan and parts of what is today the Bronx, but was then Westchester.

A brief overview of this remarkable map reveals just how isolated Japan really was prior to the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1850.  Though printed in 1840, the cartography exhibited suggests an early 17th century European perspective of the world. California is represented as an island, the mythical Terre Australis stretches across the southern latitudes, Australia is connected to both New Guinea and Terre Australis, and mysterious suggestive landmasses fill the Pacific.  The text surrounding the map itself, as well as several smaller diagrams, describe a heliocentric theory of climate and show eclipses of the Sun and Moon from this perspective. Visually the whole is beautifully if vaguely drafted using a combination of European and Edo period Japanese mapping techniques.  The map is presented in a European style double hemisphere projection and the cartography is wholly European in conception. However, the detail work and the style of the engraving itself is entirely that of Edo Japan.  This is a traditional Japanese woodblock map engraving on rice paper with mountains are shown in low profile, rivers are represented as open waterways, and regions identified by title cartouches.

","This curious comparative rivers chart published in 1834 by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge is somewhat unique in that it imagines all of the great rivers of the world letting out into a circular inland sea. Concentric circles show the general lengths of the rivers as the bird files, but cannot take into account the twists and turns of the rivers themselves. What this chart does show is, to a degree, the direction and course of the rivers' flow. Direction, which in other comparative rivers charts is indicated textually, here is illustrated visually.

In this example mountains are shown in a transparent profile with multiple ranges overlapping. While the chart focuses on the Alps, which would have been significant to the Perthes audience, it also incorporates the mountains of America, Africa, and Asia, as well as the Caucuses, Scotland and England. While this excessively complex style of rendering comparative elevation never caught on outside of Germany, its sophisticated use of profile may have had an impact on the early 20th century comparative global elevation profiles that adorn the base of many modern school maps.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/World-shincho-1848,Antique Map: 1848 Japanese Map of the World in Two Hemispheres,Shinsei yochi zenzu (ALT: Kaei kotei tozai chikyu bankoku zenzu ),"An extraordinary Japanese woodblock map of the world dating to 1848 by Shincho Kurihara and Heibe Chojiya.  This map, whose title literally translates as Newly Made Map of the Earth represents an important advancement in Japanese globular cartography.  As a result of the Sakoku or Chained Country policy enforced in Japan between 1633 and 1853, Japanese cartographers had only the vaguest ideas of what lay beyond their own well mapped borders.  What little knowledge available was usually transmitted through Dutch traders in Nagasaki and Chinese merchants who traded with the semi independent Ryukyu Kingdom to the south. Consequently, cartographic conventions common in Europe were slow to penetrate Japan.  Until about 1840, most Japanese world maps followed 17th century European maps which tended to show California as an Island and the fictional southern continent of Terre Australis, among other anomalies.  This map however, offers a more contemporary perspective generally in line with the most advanced European cartographic knowledge of the period.  Here the world is presented in a double hemisphere projection - a style that first appeared in Japan around 1810 - and cartographically is quite accurate.  California is reattached to the mainland, Australia is properly mapped including a separate Tasmania, New Zealand is correctly represented as two Islands, and Terre Australia has disappeared.  Also of note is the abandonment of the Edo era convention of using cartouches and Chinese characters to identify geographic elements.  Here most place names are rendered using the phonetic Katakana text - a uniquely Japanese adaptation to foreign linguistic borrowings.  Some traditional Japanese techniques for rendering topography have also been abandoned in favor of a European style political map.  However, there are several interesting examples of stippling used to render both deserts and offshore shoals - as in the Grand Banks and the Sahara.  Also of note is a stylized rendering of the Great Wall of China. The whole is surrounded by a traditional Japanese border with a figural draconic motif.   We have been able to identify several editions of this map, one of which has an appended text block in the lower left quadrant and some of which have a larger text block above the map proper.  This example has neither and most likely represents the earliest state of the map.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Amerique-bonne-1780,Antique Map: 1780 Raynal and Bonne Map of North America,Amerique Septentrionale.,"A fine example of Rigobert Bonne and Guilleme Raynal’s 1780 map of North America.  Covers the entire continent from the high arctic to Central America, the Caribbean, and the Spanish Main.  Offers an early perspective on the region including the identification of Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, and New England.   The representation of the western coast of the continent is exceptionally primitive and corresponds to the pre-Cook conception of the territory.  San Francisco Bay is nowhere in evidence unless it is interpreted  as the “Port of Francois Drake”, where Drake sheltered and repaired his ships in 1579 - the exact location of which remains a mystery to this day.   Alaska itself is not clearly present, but a vague mapping of an archipelago in the extreme northwest is suggestive of the Aleutian Islands.  Bonne does note the entradas of Martin d’Aguiler and Jean de Fuca as well as certain lands that he suggests are the coasts seen by the Russian Arctic explorer Tszirikow, though this too is no doubt a misinterpretation of the Aleutian Archipelago.   Bonne makes no suggestion of a northwest passage.  In fact, he closes Baffin Bay and attaches it to Greenland.  However, Bonne does leave open certain entradas, most specifically that of Jean De Fuca, suggesting a possible river route.  That said, much of the western part of the continent was entirely unexplored and, not one to presume, Bonne chose to leave it blank.  Certain American Indian nations, including the Sioux, Assenipoules, and the Apache are noted.    All in all, this is  a wonderful small map of North America just prior to the significant exploratory efforts of the late 18th and early 19th century.    Drawn by R. Bonne for G.

To make this map Mitchell compiled the mappings of Arrowsmith (1841), Fremont, Emory, Wilkes, and Nicollet, as well as making use of data from the Louis &amp; Clark expedition.

Pour le Service des Vaisseaux Français Par Ordre de M. de Sartine, Conseiller d'Etat, Ministre et Secretaire d'Etat, ayant le Département de la Marine. 1778.","A rare and extraordinary map of considerable historic importance. This map, which covers from New Jersey and Pennsylvania southward through Maryland and Virginia, then along the Carolina coast to Georgia and Florida, was issued by the French “Depot General de la Marine” in 1778. Although ostensibly a nautical chart, this map features a magnificent wealth of inland detail as far west as the Appellation Mountains and the Ohio River. Around the time this map was issued the French had been dragged into the American Revolutionary War. As a government issue map, included in the extremely rare Neptune Americo-Septentrional, this map would have been carried by most French naval, merchant marine, and other military commanders. While the French contribution to the American Revolutionary War was primarily naval, the military nature of this map gives us some insight into the superb inland detail offered. We may safely surmise that such rich inland and topographic details would have been invaluable to any French forces that may have been grounded or forced to wage a land campaign. Details political and topographical features ranging from colonial borders to rivers and swamps, such as the Okefenokee in Georgia. Shows the American Indian holdings in western Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia. The map also gives special attention to churches, missions and more specifically religious congregations, listing the Quakers, the “Assemblent les Non-confirmistes”, and others. The “Non-confirmistes” are a curious element of this map. Though to the Catholic French, this could have referred to Anglicans, Puritans, or any other Protestant group, the general location of the “Assemblent”, in western North Carolina, suggests the possibly that they were Franklinites. The coastline is dotted with innumerable detailed depth soundings.   The location of the Catawba Indians Catawbaw Town is shown south of Charlotte.  In Virginia, the town of York is noted on the York River, where we now recognize Yorktown. One can easily imagine that the French Admiral De Grasse consulting this map when, in 1781, his blockade of the York River forced the surrender of Cornwallis’ British forces at Yorktown, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War.      This map was commissioned by Antoine de Sartine for inclusion in the Neptune Americo-Septentrional. It was engraved by Petit. Though his name does not appear on the map, the cartographic work behind this map is most likely the legacy of the late ingénieur hydrographe Jacques-Nicolas Bellin. Though dated 1778, this is mostly likely the second state of this rare map as is suggested by the removeal of Petit’s full title “Graveur du Roi et de la Marine” in the lower left hand corner and the addition of a price, “Pris Trois Livres” in the lower right.",1778 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sartine.txt,"<i>Neptune Americo-Septentrional</i>, 1778 edition.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Carolina-sartine-1778.jpg,Carolina-sartine-1778,34,23

This is an important early map of Scandinavia by cartographer Martin Waldseemuller. It is heavily based on the similar map by Claudius Clavus, which appeared in the 1425 Ulm edition of Ptolemy's Geographia.  The most notable difference between this edition is the addition of armorial shields for the Scandinavian countries. In this map, much of the geography is conjectural at best.  Iceland, Norway, and Sweden are nearly unrecognizable.  At the top of the map, Greenland appears connected to the mainland by a narrow land bridge.

Boulton himself advertises “The inland parts of Africa being but very little known and the names of the regions and countries which fill that vast tract of land being for the greatest part placed by conjecture it may be judged how absurd are the divisions traced in some maps and why they are not followed in this.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/PensylvaniaNovaJersey-lotter-1756,"Antique Map: 1756 Lotter Map of Pennsylvania, New Jersey & New York","Pensylvania Nova Jersey et Nova York cum Regionibus Ad Fluvium Delaware In America Sitis, Nova Delinatione ob oculos posita . . .","A fine and rare 1756 example of Tobias Conrad Lotter’s important map of the Middle Atlantic and New England regions during the British colonial period. One of the most desirable, interesting and attractive pre-Revolutionary maps of the Middle English Colonies, particularly New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania obtainable. Covers from Lake Ontario in the northwest eastward to the Atlantic and as far south as Maryland, Delaware and the Chesapeake Bay. Cartographically this map is heavily based upon the exceedingly rare 1849 map of the same region published by Lewis Evans in 1749. German immigration to Pennsylvania and New York was flourishing in the mid-18th century and consequently the demand in Germany for a good map of the region was high. Evans’ map offered the perfect solution to this need and was almost immediately pirated as the, “Special Land Charte von Pensilvanen...” by an unknown Frankfurt publisher. The Frankfurt map in turn was also almost immediately (in the same year) pirated by the prosperous firm of Mattias Seutter. Seutter’s son-in-law, Tobias Conrad Lotter, was charged with the preparation and engraving of this map and it is his hand and style that we see here. The Seutter firm issued and reissued this map in several variants over the upcoming decade. In 1756 Lotter, following Suetter’s death and his subsequent takeover of the firm, replaced Seutter’s name on the map with his own. This is thus third state or 1756 edition.      The original Evans map was intended as a map of the British colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is shown bounded by the Appellations in accordance with the land purchases William Penn made from the Iroquois League. New York in divided into three parts comprising of what is today New York and Vermont. Manhattan is shown attached to the mainland and Brooklyn appears as “Brockland”.      On a more furtive level, Evans’ maps was also a spy map of the Indian territories west of the Appellation Mountains. As the inhabited parts of Pennsylvania and New York slowly stretched westward into Indian lands, the governing bodies became increasingly aware of the need for accurate reconnaissance of the region. Evans was one of the first cartographers to penetrate and offer a reasonably accurate map of these areas. The map offers good reference to previously unmapped Indian villages, tribal regions, forts, and river ways.      The portions of Lotter’s map that were drawn directly from the Evans map are therefore surprisingly accurate. In a departure from the Evans, map, however, Lotter also decided to include within the boundaries of his map the coast of New England and the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. These areas appear as if they were added as an afterthought and are consequently wildly, almost humorously, inaccurate. Indeed, it almost seems as if New England was molded to fit the map plate rather than the map made to fit New England. Boston and Cape Cod are drawn well within the boundaries of Connecticut. The western border of New Hampshire is entirely made of up the Atlantic seaboard. Rhode Island just obscenely into Connecticut which itself in distended along the vertical. All four of the New England colonies shown are also miniaturized along the horizontal.      The decorative title cartouche in the upper left quadrant depicts William Penn surrounded by the flora and fauna of the region – turkeys, deer, rabbits, etc…, purchasing land from the indigenous American Indian tribes.      Many issues of this map have a very weak impression due to overuse of the original plate. This particular map on the other hand has a fine dark impression and is consequently a rare find.",1756 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/lotter.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/PensylvaniaNovaJersey-lotter-1756.jpg,PensylvaniaNovaJersey-lotter-1756,19.5,22.5

Depicts the United States and Mexico roughly from the Atlantic to the region immediately west of the Rocky Mountains, including the massive Missouri Territory, Texas and parts of Mexico. This map was produced by the joint efforts of three important American mapmakers: John Melish, Benjamin Tanner, and Mathew Cary. It had its origins in Melish’s 1812 pocket format map of the United States. Over the following fifteen years the map would be updated, revised, and improved for various reissues. The current example is from Carey and Lea’s  Atlas .  Referencing the cartographic and exploratory work of Lewis and Clark, Pike, and Major Long, this map attempted to give an accurate picture of the western United States. Shows both the newly formed state of Missouri and the massive Missouri Territory. This extraordinary tract of land extended form the Mississippi River westward off the edge of the map. In a seminal move that would later define the boundaries between the United States and New Spain, Melish delineated the 100th meridian as the border between Mexico ( Texas ) and the United States. Heading east, the border continued south along the Arkansas River and then eastward along the Red River Valley. The Arkansas Territory extended westward as far as Texas including the territory claimed by the modern day state of Oklahoma. On the eastern side of the Mississippi we see a large Northwest Territory bounded by Michigan on the east and Illinois on the south. The part of Michigan Territory on the western side of Lake Michigan is shown extending southward as far as the Illinois border. Virginia remains undivided. South of the border, in Mexico and Texas, New Mexico is shown as a sliver of land, containing Taos and Santa Fe, extending along the Rio Bravo (Rio del Norte) into the Intendency of Durango. Texas place names include Mesa, Loredo, San Saba, San Antonio, Pres del Alter, Ft. Matagorda, Nacagdoches, Panee Village, Cardo Village, Haytones, and Galvezton (Galveston) well inland on the Rio de Nieves or Neches. Apache Indians shown in Big Bend country. The map as a whole features excellent detail regarding mountain ranges and river valleys. Attempts with some success to place the various American Indian tribes as well as forts and cities. Also includes explorer’s notes, mostly referencing Louis and Clark, in the Missouri Territory. All in all, one of the most important maps of the United States published and a must for any serious Texas or Transmississippi collection.

This is an extremely rare variant on the map of Central Park that originally appeared in the 1862 Comissioner’s Report. This variant lacks the title, which is printed at the top of the 1862 map, but depicts more of the surrounding area, especially the Upper West Side, and features a decorative border. Depicts the park as a whole and includes pathways, lakes, buildings, individual trees, rocks, and elevation measurements. The streets and avenues surrounding the park as well as the tramways that existed at the time are also noted.  This extraordinary map reveals Central Park as conceived by the Landscape Architects, and indeed “artists”, Vaux and Olmstead. Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council. Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park. The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design. The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned. Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Historian Gloria Deak writes, “There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’” Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privilege of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban public recreation area in the world.",1868,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sarony.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CentralPark-CentralPark-1869.jpg,CentralPark-CentralPark-1869,30.5,8.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/VirginiaMarylandiaCarolina-homann-1715,"Antique Map: 1715 Homann Map of Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey",Virginia Marylandia et Carolina In America Septentrionali Britannorum industria excultae…,"An exceptionally beautiful example of J. B.  Homann's c. 1715 map of Virginia, Carolina, Maryland, and New Jersey; considered one of the most important and decorative maps of is region to appear in the 18th century.  This fine decorative map covers from New York City and Long Island south along the Atlantic Cost as far as modern day Georgia, and as far west as Lake Erie.  Homann drew this map in response to Virginia Lieutenant-Governor Alexander Spotswood's plan to settled the little known interior of Virginia with German immigrants.   Shown here is the first mapping of Germantown Teutsche Statt on the Rappahanock River and Fort Christanna (Christ Anna Fort) on the Makharing River.  Fort Christanna was built with the intention of defending the region against incursions from hostile American Indian groups such as the Tuscarora to the west.  Christanna also acted as the headquarters of the Virginia Indian Company, a stock venture founded in 1714 with the intention of trading with indigenous groups in the interior.  Though Homann's remarkable representation of Spottswood's plan is extraordinarily up-to-date considering that Fort Christana was founded in the same year that this map was initially published, the remainder of the map embraces a number of common misconceptions and cartographic inaccuracies common to the region.   Probably the most notable of these is his inclusion of Apalache Lacus.  This fictional lake, the source of the May River, appeared on maps of this region since the mid 16th century Le Moyne-De Bry map and was popularized by Mercator and Hondius in 1606.  It would remain on maps well into the mid 18th century before exploration and settlement finally disproved the theory.   Further north Lake Erie and been expanded dramatically and shifted somewhat to the south where it takes on the appearance of a vast inland sea occupying the entire northwestern quadrant of the map.  This region, west of the English colonies and north as far as Pennsylvana, Homann attaches to the Spanish claims in Florida.  Homan's also offers a wealth of detail along the Atlantic coast, where most of the European colonization efforts were focused.  From Long Island, about two-thirds of which is shown, south to Craven County, Carolina, countless towns and cities are identified.  New York City is mapped on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, but is not specifically labeled.   New Jersey is divided into the colonial provinces of East New Jersey and West New Jersey.  Curiously Homann maps a large inland lake Zuyd Lac straddling the New Jersey - Pennsylvania border. This is no doubt a early misinterpretation of the natural widening of the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap.  Heading south along the Delaware River Philadelphia is identified and beautifully rendered as a grid embraced in four quadrants.  Both the Delaware Bay and the Chesapeake Bay are rendered in full and even include a number of undersea notations and depth soundings.  In Virginia and Carolina the river systems  are surprisingly well mapped and a primitive county structure is beginning to emerge.  The early Virginia counties of Rappahannock, Henrico, City, Isle of Wright, Nansemond, Northumberland, Middlesex, Gloster and Corotvk are noted.  Similarly in Carolina a number of counties are named, most of which refer to the Lords Proprietors, including Albemarle, Clarenden, and Craven.  Cape Fear, Cape Lookout, and Cape Hattaras are noted and a number of anchorages, reefs, and depth sounding are noted along the entire coastline.  The lower right quadrant of this map is occupied by a fabulous decorative title cartouche.  Centered on an enormous scallop shell bearing the map's title and Homann's Privilege, the cartouche features a number of stylized American Indians trading with European merchants.  The wealth of the region is expressed by an abundance of fish, game, and other trade products.",1715 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/homann.txt,"Homann, J.

Covers from the St. Lawrence River to Lake Champlain inclusive of the counties of St. Lawrence, Clinton, Essex, Hamilton, Warren, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, and Oneida. The whole is surrounded by an elaborate decorative vine motif border. Printed by G.W. and C. B. Colton of 172 William Street, New York.

Colton &amp; Co in the Clerks Office of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York.”  With its lush wilderness, rich wildlife, and plethora of lakes and rivers, the Adirondack Mountains were a popular sporting and fishing destination for much of the 19th century. As early as the 1850s it was a favorite stomping ground for such luminaries as James Russell Lowell, Louis Agassiz, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Nonetheless, it wasn’t until 1867 that a reliable map of this region appeared. The Adirondacks’ rugged rurality, lakes, mountains, and rivers proved a daunting obstacle for 19th century surveyors and cartographers. The work of Rochester physician and enthusiastic Adirondack sportsman W.W. Ely finally opened up this region cartographically. This map, the product of Ely’s efforts and experience, was praised by his successor Wallace: To Dr. W. W. Ely, as the pioneer in recording these unmapped portions, and making reasonably plain to those who should follow the devious windings of stream and trail, is due to the gratitude of thousands who have acknowledged the benefit derived from his valuable map of “the New York wildness,” which, up to the present time, has been the only one worthy of name as such. And indeed Dr. Ely produced a magnificent map. Spacious in size and with a focus on detail, this map notes roads, paths, lakes, rivers, rapids, mines, waterfalls, villages, lodges, and farmsteads thought the region. As the first reasonably accurate map of the Adirondacks, “the New York Wilderness” enjoyed an immediately popularity and was subsequently published in a similar state for the next two years. Afterwards, the map was reduced, redrawn, and reissued in a smaller borderless format entitled “New York Wilderness and the Adirondacks”.",1867 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/colton.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Adirondacks-colton-1867.jpg,Adirondacks-colton-1867,40,27.5

The world is depicted according to the political conventions of the late 19th century. While most of the world had been explored by the late 19th century, this map does offer some interesting speculative land masses in the Arctic including Gillis Land (named after a c. 1707 whaler who supposedly spotted it) and a mysterious land mass to the northwest of the Behring Strait.   The Canadian Arctic is remarkable well mapped though the whole region is shows to be locked down in glacial ice.    In contrast Antarctic exploration was still in its infancy, though parts of the Antarctic coast line are noted to the south of Australia and off the coast of Tierra  del Fuego.   Throughout there is an attempt to map currents and wind patterns.  Various explorers routes, including Cook, Biscoe, Tasman, Wilkes, Vancouver, the Resolution, Wallis, Boupet, Diego Alvarez, Bligh, Boulton, and many others. This also identifies the Saragasso Sea and another similar vortex in the Pacific.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NewYorkCity-langdon-1831,Antique Map: 1831 J. Langdon Pocket Map of New York City,A New Map of the City of New York Comprising all the Late Improvements.,"A very obscure pocket map of New York City issued in 1831 by J. Langdon of 151 Fulton Street.  Oriented to the west,  Langdon's map covers New York from Forty Fifth street south to the Battery.   This map divides and color codes the city according to wards, of which there are 14.  All streets are noted as are piers, slips, parks, and important public buildings including Bellevue Hospital, the West Battery Castle, City Hall, the House of Refuge, the Alms House, and the Penitentiary.    In terms of Parks, City Hall Park, Washington Square Park, the Battery, and the Parade (today's Madison Square Park) are noted.    This map appeared at an exciting time in the development of New York City and was drawn, as the title suggests, to illustrate the many civic improvement and developments in process.  These included the Lower East Side Landfill, commercial and real estate developments in what was then the northern part of New York City (indicated by shading), and the construction of various docks, piers and ferry crossings.   At the base of the map there are views of City Hall and the Merchant's Exchange.  This map appears to be nearly identical to S. Mark's pocket map of the same that was issued in 1827 and folded into J. Hardie's  Description of the City of New York .  The Marks edition was issued uncolored. Langdon's edition appears to be an independent issue and generally appears with original color.  The use of Mark's plan may either represent a sale of the plate to Langdon or outright plagiarism - both of which were common at the time.",1831 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/langdon.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NewYorkCity-langdon-1831.jpg,NewYorkCity-langdon-1831,15,13

This is the second issue of this important map following the earlier edition by J. B. Homann.  Map reflects a considerable advancement in American cartography of the time as well as a general increase in knowledge regarding America’s interior from explorations and colonizations. Map immediately precedes the French and Indian War, so the French are shown to dominate North American while the Spanish are preeminent in the south.   The Pacific Northwest is largely unexplored, but nonetheless, the mythical Northwest Passage is shown.  As is the mythical Quivira, “Land of Gold and Silver”, sought after by conquistador Francisco de Coronado in 1541.  The beautiful decorative title cartouche in the lower left quadrant depicts two erupting volcanoes and several American Indians, one of which is seems to be holding aloft a shrunken head or similar idol.  An important early map of the Americas.      This map was included in the 1752 Homann Heirs Maior Atlas Scholasticus ex Triginta Sex Generalibus et Specialibus….  Most early Homann atlases were “made to order” or compiled of individual maps at the request of the buyer. However, this rare atlas, composed of 37 maps and charts, was issued as a “suggested collection” of essential Homann Heirs maps.

Burr and Edward Walker’s important pocket map of the City of New York.  Covers New York City south of 26th street on the west side and south of 40th street on the east side.  Shows the city in considerable detail with attention to churches, theaters, ferries, government buildings, museums, and other public centers.   Columbia College is noted on Murray Street.  Also notes the Fulton Fish Market, St. Marks Church in the East Village and the nation’s first hospital at Bellevue.  This map includes parts of Brooklyn and Williamsburg, which, at the time, were separate cities.   The proposed landfill in the East River just south of Bellevue is projected, but would remain incomplete for several years following the issue of this map.  Burr issued this map in various states from 1834 to 1845 in conjunction with two separate publishers, Edward Walker (114 Fulton Street) and J. H. Colton (172 William Street).  The Colton variants are sometimes dated, but Walker did not put a date stamp on his issues, thus making this map very difficult to date with precision.  What we do know is that later issues contained a legend in the lower left hand quadrant which ours does not, marking it as an earlier variant.  Engraved by S. Stiles of Wall Street, New York.

This is one of the largest and most impressive maps of India to emerge in the 19th century.  This chart depicts the subcontinent from Bombay ( Mumbai ) and Aurangabad, south including the northern half of Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Though largely based on the 18th century mapmaking work of James Rennell, Wyld has significantly updated the Faden's cartographic representation of India by incorporating the survey work of Sir Archibald Campbell, Col. Kelly, Captain Pringle, and Colonel Allen.  Consequently the issue of this important map marks a significant advancement in the 18th century perspective of India.  The subcontinent is now crisscrossed with a broad network of roadways and significant interior detail has been added throughout.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Brooklyn-mccloskey-1863,"Antique Map: 1863 McCloskey Pocket Map of Brooklyn, New York",Map of the Consolidated City of Brooklyn.,"An extremely rare first edition  of Henry McCloskey’s 1863 pocket map of the city of Brooklyn, New York.  In the mid 19th century, fueled by the advent of the steam ferry, which made crossing the East River practical, Kings County experienced an massive population burst.  Wealthy and poor alike were quick to abandon the dirty and claustrophobic Manhattan for then suburban lands just across the East River.  In 1855 the communities of Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Bushwick and Williamsburg were consolidated by the State of New York into one large city, modern day Brooklyn.  It was around this time that the term “Kings County” began to fall out of popular usage in favor of “Brooklyn”.    By 1865, two years after this map was printed, Brooklyn had become the third largest city in America, following New York and Philadelphia.  Here Brooklyn is revealed in the midst of this incredible development.  Prospect Park, which was still being built, is shown, as is Greenwood cemetery.  The street layout, mimicking the grid system of Manhattan, is shown in considerable detail.  Attemptes to detail important buildings, ferry crossings, bridges, train lines, and “plank roads.”  Also notes public buildings and lands such as the Lunatic Asylum, the Hospital, the Alms House, the Military Parade Grounds, the Marine Hospital and the Navy Yard.  Manhattan appears in the lower left hand corner of the map.  North is oriented to the lower left. The whole is surrounding by a decorative vine and leave border.  This map was drawn by A. Brown of 47 Nassau Street, New York, for inclusion in Henry McCloskey’s 1863 Manual of the City and Corporation of Brooklyn.  Cartographically this map references and expands upon the 1846 map of Brooklyn surveyed and prepared by Richard Butt.

Raynal’s 1780 map Southern Africa.  Essentially two maps in one which, between them, cover the entire southern portion of the continent.   The main map, on the right, covers from the Cape of Good Hope north as far as Zanzibar and modern day Kenya, focusing on the gold rich kingdom of Monomotapa.  This region, today part of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, was once rich in gold and was often associated with the Biblical kingdom of  Ophir, which is mentioned in the legend of King Solomon's Mines.   This was one of the first parts of eastern Africa to be explored and colonized by Portuguese traders looking for a source of gold to rival that of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru.  Unfortunately for everyone involved the Mines of Solomon had been all but exhausted shortly before the Europeans arrived.  Just north of Monomotapa a very embryonic mapping of Lake Malawi appears with no defined northern terminus.     Offshore Madagascar and the many Indian Ocean islands surrounding it are well mapped with considerable though inaccurate inland detail.  Arrows show the direction of tradewinds and dotted lines identify some offshore reefs and other dangers.  The secondary map, occupying the left hand quadrants of the chart, details the Dutch claims in the western of South Africa from the Cape of Good Hope north as far as St. Helens Bay.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Wisconsin-chapman-1856,Antique Map: 1856 Chapman Pocket Map of Wisconsin,Chapman’s Sectional Map of Wisconsin.,"This is an extremely rare and unusual 1856 pocket map of Wisconsin by  Silas Chapman.  Chapman appears to have published two maps pocket maps of Wisconsin in 1856, this map, delineating the entire state, and a another smaller map showing only the surveyed portions (bottom 2/3rd) of the state. This larger map is by far the rarer of the two.   Consists of the entire state bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the East by Lake Michigan, and on the west by Minnesota Territory.  The copyright data at the bottom of the map has a date of 1855, but below the title an 1856 date appears.  Our research shows no evidence an 1855 version of this map actually being printed.  Chapman did issue a smaller version of his Wisconsin map in the 1855 “Traveler’s and Immigrants Guide,” but there seems to have been no independent issue of a Sectional Map of Wisconsin of this size and form until 1856.  The coloration of this map, with light red outlines defining the counties and the state itself outlined in blue, is very similar to that which appears in the map issued with the “Traveler’s and Immigrants Guide”, but is quite different from other versions of this map also dated 1856.  Nor is the red linen binder similar to other 1856 issues which used green linen. This leads us to believe that this map is in fact a very early 1856 printing, most probably a first state and first edition, of this important Wisconsin map.  Depicts the state of Wisconsin in considerable detail especially in the surveyed portions of the state.  Notes several American Indian reservations include the Menomnee Reservation and the Oneida Reservation.  Includes town, cities and smaller settlements, saw mills, rapids, waterfalls, roads, creeks, lakes, forts, and rivers.   This map also notes  the site near Praire du Sac where the Black Hawk War’s Battle of Wisconsin Heights was fought.  In this historic last stand, a mere 60 Sauk warriors held off over 700 U.S. regulars and militia under the command of Henry Dodge while the Indian women and children crossed the river to safety.  At dawn the Sauk chief Neapope, concealed in a tree, verbally offered to negotiate surrender.  The U.S. soldiers, lacking an interpreter, ignored his plea.  Further east, along the Mississippi, the map also shows the site of the Massacre of Bad Axe.  Fleeing the aftermath of the Battle of Wisconsin Heights the remaining Sauk, mostly women and children, were cornered against the Mississippi River and slaughtered.",1856 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/chapman.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Wisconsin-chapman-1856.jpg,Wisconsin-chapman-1856,31.5,35.5

Depicts the peninsula and town of Gibraltar from an east facing  view perspective.  The town of Gibraltar is well laid out with 31 important numbered locations throughout, all of which are referenced in a table below the map.  Two additional views depict the promontory from different directions showing “the Rock’s” dramatic rise in elevation.  In the lower right hand quadrant of the map numerous rabbits are drawn frolicking and sleeping around the inset.  This likely a reference to the indigenous fauna of the promontory, which, given its rocky and barren situation, is limited to rabbits and other small mammals.    We believe this to be the first edition of this map which was re-published in various formats throughout the 1720s and 1730s.  Gibraltar is a rocky promontory on the southernmost extension of the Iberian Peninsula.  Due to its strategic location at the entrance to the Mediterranean, it has long been a spot of military and political contention.  Gibraltar was seized by British and Dutch troops during the 1704 Spanish War of Succession and in 1713 the Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the war, upheld the English claim.  Cartographers and map publishers quickly capitalized on a general interest in the War and began advertize maps and plans of “the Rock”.    For want of good cartographic material, most of the publishers of the time, including Covens and Mortier, Henrich de Leth, and others, relied on reissues of this older map.  This particular map seems to have been based stylistically upon the map drawn by Spaniard Don Luis Bravo Acuña in 1627.  Both maps feature a similar view perspective as well as an east-facing orientation.",1720,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/lafeuille.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Gibraltar-lafeuille-1720.jpg,Gibraltar-lafeuille-1720,18.25,7

Raynal’s 1780 map of the world on a hemispherical projection. Offers a number of interesting details corresponding to the knowledge of the world at the time.  Western North America exhibits a pre-Cook configuration with a curious archipelago that can be understood as a proto-understanding of the Aleutian Islands.  On the opposite side of the world Tasmania is joined to the mainland of Australia.

Extends from Europe and Africa eastward through Arabia and India to include the East Indies, Siberia, the Philippines, and a partial New Guinea ( Nova Guniea ).   The superb detailing of China’s interior probably references the work of early Jesuit missionaries to this region.   The Kamchatka peninsula has been updated from earlier Homann work to more accurately reflect its actual size.  The region of Siberia remains quite primitive in conception and is clearly based on Russian survey work from the 1730s.  In Japan, Hokkaido ( Terra Eso, Yedso, Yesfo ) is wildly distended in form and attached to the Asian mainland.  To the west of Hokkaido appears a curious partial territory labeled “Terra Societatis Batavicae” which though considerably deformed, can only be a primitive strike at the archipelago that runs from Hokkaido to Kamchatka.  Upper right quadrant features a decorated scale of miles.  Lower right quadrant features an allegorical title cartouche depicting an Asian king enthroned and, curiously, what appears to be an American Indian female with a bow, an arrow, and feathered headdress.     Along the top of the map, an alternate title reads: Carte de l'Asie, projettée stereographiquement, tirée des relations et observations Atlas compendiarius quinquaginta tabularum geographicarum Homannianarum.

Covers from roughly Michoacán Mexico, west to Surinam, north as far as modern day Virginia and south as far as modern day Ecuador.   The cartography exhibited here almost certainly references the important 1698 map of North America attributed to Friar Hennepin.   The mouth and course of the Mississippi River are displaced far to the west of their actual location and are shown roughly where Galveston Harbor and Sabine Lake are now.  Roughly where the actual mouth of the Mississippi is located, this map suggests a large bay which it calls “Baye de Spirito Sancto”.  Florida is misshapen with no trace of the Keys.  Further south, the West Indies are fairly well mapped suggesting a relative accurate picture of the islands.  Following the lead of Bleau and Hondius, the mainland of Mexico and Central America is wildly exaggerated along the horizontal.  Yucatan is also extremely misshapen.  In the north, the lake of Apalache, which first appeared in Jacque Le Moyne’s early 17th century map of Florida, is shown as the source of the St. John’s River.  In today’s Texas, this map notes several mines and Indian villages including a stylized typee.   Expanding upon Hennapin’s work,  Ruyter includes a number of bays in southwestern Florida and adds the Negrillos Islands.    The fascinating allegorical title cartouche in the upper right quadrant of this map deserves special attention.  In a departure from the traditional iconography for America, ( Indians, sheep, bears, buffalo, etc. ) there appears a unicorn killing a  ram, an eagle, a couple of jack rabbits, and a naval fleet.  Ruyter was no doubt inspired by the 1671 work of Arnold Montanus , “The New and Unknown World,” in which eagles and unicorns appear as the indigenous fauna of North America.  In the background, the fallen pillars and naval armada most likely refer to the annual arrival in Porto Bello of the Spanish treasure fleet from Europe via the Pillars of Hercules.

Though quite late compared to colonial period information it presents, this map is significant in that it is possibly the first map to show the whole of Manhattan Island during the Revolutionary War.

Mendez, Almeida, Pais, Lobo, e Lodulfo del P. M. Coronelli M.C. Cosmografo della Seren. Rep. di Ventia…","This is Coronelli's important 1690 map of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) showing the source of the Blue Nile.    This map, focusing on Lake Tana (Tzana Dembea) covers the Ethiopian highlands from Derbeta on the Red Sea south as far as the tribal  kingdoms of Sugame, Bahargamo and Gumar, all of which are located in modern southern Ethiopia. Europeans, Coronelli included, had a great interest in this region not only because of common conjecture regarding the source of the Nile, but also as a potential site of the Kingdom of Prester John.   Though often underappreciated by historians, this is a highly significant map in the development of African cartography and, from the early 18th century on, most cartographers followed its example with regard to this important region - one of the few parts of sub-Saharan Africa to be accurately represented on maps prior to the late 19th century.   Coronelli claims that this is the first map to accurately depict the sources of the Nile and, at least as regards the Blue Nile, we see no reason to dispute his claim.  The cartography here is based upon the travels of Portuguese Jesuits Manuel de Almeida, Affonso Mendez, Pedro Páez, and Jerónimo Lobo, who traveled throughout Abyssinia in the mid 16th century.  Coronelli correctly recognizes the importance of Lake Tana (Tzana Dembea) as well as the curious turn in the river that actually causes the Blue Nile to start it course as a southerly flowing river.   The actual fonts of the Nile itself appear to the southwest of Lake Tana.   The Falls of the Blue Nile, now a popular tourist destination in Ethiopia, are noted just south of the Lake.   In the upper right quadrant Coronelli contrasts his perspective on the region with the traditional Ptolemaic representation of the Nile River stemming from two great lakes south of the Equator.  Ironically, both perspectives are somewhat correct.   Coronelli's representation of Abysinnia is highly accurate with regard to the course of the Blue Nile and its sources.  On the other hand, along with the Ptolemaic theory, Coronelli seems to ignore the entire White Nile which meanders into non-existence in the extreme left hand quadrants of the map.  The Ptolemaic perspective depicted on the upper right, though it is based on speculative accounts dating to antiquity, actually offers a fairly accurate representation of the White Nile's course northward from Lake Victoria, which is in fact located just below the Equator.   Coronelli's map also offers much of interest beyond  its intended purpose - that is to show the course of the Nile.  A number of the earliest Ethiopian towns, cities, monasteriesc,and kingdoms, many of which still exist, are in evidence.  These include  Axum, Asmara, Gojiam, di Cafate (Kaffa), di Ganz , di Dembea (north of Lake Tana), Tigre, di Amhara (welo), Ifat, Guraghe, Damot, Balli, Dawaro, Sugamo (Sidamo?), Angot, Bagemder and Midrabahr ( Bahrmedr), among others.  Curiously the map does not name the early Abyssinian capital city of Gondar, though the tent encampment of the King is roughly identified in the same location.   A decorative title cartouche appears on the lower right quadrant.  Another cartouche, showing a no less than six distance scales adorns the lower left.",1690 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/coronelli.txt,"Coronelli, V.

The map depicts the provinces of East and West Florida as they emerged following the Treaty of Paris that ended the French and Indian War.   The treaty ceded to the British control of most of the North America territory east of the Mississippi River.  The treaty included an agreement with Spain to exchange Cuba for Florida.  The British quickly set up two new provinces divided by the Apalachicola River.  West Florida comprised the territory between the Apalachicola River and the Mississippi River.  East Florida included most of the peninsula of Florida.   The division was intended by the British to reduce conflicts between colonists and the Native Americans of the region by outlawing English settlement (except for the coast) west of the Apalachicola River.   The map itself attempts to depict the region in considerable detail and includes political boundaries, cities, forts, canals, rivers, swamps and American Indian Tribes.  Extends from New Orleans and the Mississippi River east to the Bahamas, which are shown in full, north as far as Savannah and south as far as Cuba.   A large inset in the lower left quadrant depicts Pensacola bay and harbor with detailed depth soundings and individual buildings noted.

A map of considerable importance, this chart was constructed during a period of aggressive exploration into this region.  Explorers, seeking a “westward passage” to the Pacific, believed an inland water route was not only reasonable, but highly likely.  With no concept that the vast barrier of the Rocky Mountains stood in their way, they mapped out the likely courses for this route, as depicted on this map.  They believed one could pass through the Great Lakes and, roughly following the current US-Canada border, pass upriver to Rainey Lake (L. Tecamamiouen)and then, through another River, to the Lake of the Woods (Lac des Bois), then, via another river, to (though it does not appear on this map) Lake Winnipeg. Here the water route westward ends - though at the time they didn't know it. Throughout this map, Bonne attempts to document rivers, mountains, forts, and American Indian tribes and villages with the most recent data obtainable. He identifies the lands of the Sioux, the Iroquois (Five Nations), the Algonquians, the Illinois, and many others. Chicago (Chicagou) and Detroit both appear as forts. The Great Lakes are mapped with a rough approximation of accuracy, though Lake Superior does include a number of apocryphal islands including I. Ponchartrain and I. Minong (also known as Phillipeaux). These islands first appeared Bellin's mapping of the region in 1750s and continued to appear until the 1820s.  Also of note are the possible headwaters of the Mississippi, which the map describes as “La Source en est inconnue”.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/America-mannert-1796,Antique Map: 1796 Mannert Map of North America and South America," America nach der zweyten Ausgabe von Arrowsmiths Weltcharte und dessen Globular Projection nach den Berichten der Jesuiten und anderer Reisebe Schreiber, und nach Raymals, Gatterers, Angaben entworten von C. Mannert.","An extremely scarce 1796 map of north and south America by C. Mannert.  Depicts the Americas shortly following the close of  the American Revolutionary War in 1783.  The whole is color coded according to political conventions, with British controlled territories in Red, Spanish dominions in yellow, French in green, and the fledgling United States in blue-green. Mountains and other topographical features are rendered by hachure, making Mannert's 1796 map one of the first to employ this mapping convention. Throughout, Mannert has dedicated significant attention to the naming of various American Indian nations including the Sioux, Otter, Sack, Creek (Crik), Miami, Paduca, Arkansas, and others. Cartographically Mannert references the work of Aaron Arrowsmith published in the same year, though it is far from a copy with numerous refinements and advancements in evidence.  Mannert recognizes the United States east of the Mississippi, south of the Great Lakes, and north of Florida.  None of the original states are identified, however the regions of Carolina, Georgia, and Kentuke are noted.  This map's most interesting element is most likely it's treatment of the western parts of North America.  At the extreme west the  discoveries of Captain Cook are evident in the well defined coastlines as far north as Alaska.  Here the Bering Strait has been renamed Cook's Strasse. Drakes harbor, the mysterious location where Sir Frances Drake repaired his ships (and claimed New Albion for England) on his historic circumnavigation, is here identified with San Francisco Bay.  Further inland the cartography becomes increasingly vague with places like Teguayo, Quivara, and Cenis (all remnants early ingressions into this region by the likes of Coronado and de  Soto) appearing throughout.  Teguayo, a semi-mythical kingdom of gold and wealth imagined by the nefarious Spanish count and governor of New Mexico Pansilo de Navarez, is attached to an embryonic Great Salt Lake - no doubt drawn and adapted from Escalante's journals.   Further north, near today's U.S. - Canada border another lake appears - this one much larger and labeled See.  This unusual body of water is most likely a remnant of the mythical Sea of the West, a speculative lake proposed by 18th century French theoretical cartographers.  Further north still we can see traces of the exploratory work of MacKenzie and Hearne, both fur traders whose overland treks in northwestern Canada along the MacKenzie and Coppermine Rivers, respectively, finally ended speculation about a river passage to the Pacific via the Hudson Bay.    At the opposite extreme of this map South America appears well mapped with significant inland detail throughout.  However, though based upon missionary reports and mapping conventions dating to the time of the Conquistadores, much of this cartography is speculative at best.  Unlike North America, much of the South American coastline was mapped early on in the history of American exploration.  However, the interior was vague and confusing to cartographers who had difficulty embracing the complexities of mapping the continent's impenetrable rainforests, great flood plains, and vast winding river systems.  Nonetheless, many confusions appearing on earlier (and indeed later) maps have here been semi-corrected.  Both Lake Parima (south Guyana) and the Laguna de Xarayes (northern terminus of the Paraguay River) have been significantly reduced in size.  These were flood plains, the Parima and Pantanal, that were mistakenly taken for lakes during their annual inundation and both of which were associated with legends of El Dorado.     All text is in German.  Prepared on a scale of 1:20,000,000.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Africa-cruttwell-1799,Antique Map: 1799 Clement Cruttwell Map of Africa,Africa.,"A fine 1799 map of Africa by the English map publisher Clement Cruttwell.  Covers the entire region, including a detailed inset of the rivers of Sierra Leone and Sherbro (labeled “A correct chart of the Rivers Sierra Leone and Sherbro.”)  Of note is the way Cruttwell carefully labeled the interior of Africa; at this point in the time it was only the coastal regions of the continent that had been explored in any extent. Cruttwell, however, notes each African Kingdom and tribe thought to exist throughout the continent.  In central Africa, for instance, one can find the Jages, who are defined as Antrhopophages or cannibals.  Many of Cruttwell’s ideas and mappings of the interior of Africa proved to be misguided or completely wrong.  The path of the White Nile, for instance, is incorrect and follows the conjecture laid down by Coronelli nearly 300 years earlier.  What Cruttwell labels as Lake of Zambre is most likely an embryonic mapping Lake Malawi.    Cruttwell also makes note of the “Hottentots” in South Africa.  The “Hottentots” were actually what some Europeans called the Khoikhoi (people people or real people) or Khoi.  (The term “Hottentot”, an imitation of the sound of the Khoisan languages, is considered derogatory today.) The Khoi are the native people of southwestern Africa, and are closely related to the Bushmen.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Asia-cruttwell-1799,Antique Map: 1799 Clement Cruttwell Map of Asia,Asia,"A fine 1799 map of Asia by the English map publisher Clement Cruttwell.  Cruttwell's map covers the entire continent from Turkey to Japan and from the Arctic to the East Indies.  Our survey of this remarkable continental map begins in the northern regions, which exhibit a primitive yet ephemeral understanding of Arctic geography particularly in Siberia and the extreme northeast where traces of Tschirikow and Vitus Bering’s explorations are in evidence.  The map centers on the vast stretch of land between the Sea of Korea and Kamchatka and the Caspian Sea, known for most of the 18th century as Tartary.  This area was once part of the vast Mongol Empire consolidated under Genghis Khan around 1206 AD.  Although the empire of the Great Khan had long since disintegrated into constituent states by the time this map was made, this little known and largely inaccessible region held a special fascination for western Europeans who were reared on legends of the dreaded Mongols or Tartars and their leader, the terrifying Scourge of God.  Consequently, much of the geography of Central Asia represented here references these early conquests.  Genghis Khan’s largly abondoned capital at Kara Koram is noted, as are the silk route trading centers of Samarkand, Bokara, and Kashgar (Cashgar).  Further south, the better known regions of Arabia, Persia, India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, the East Indies, Japan and Korea are relatively well mapped.  Between Japan and Korea the “Sea of Korea” or Sea of Japan is noted.  Today scholars in both countries are arguing over this sea’s proper name, making it an issue of national pride, with each insisting it be named after their own country.  Japan itself is only roughly mapped according to a very ancient convention orienting the main island on an east-west rather than north south axis.  Hokkaido, here called Yesso, is not attached to Japan but is rather joined to Eastern Tartary or Mongolia. Tibet its worth noting as it includes a much larger area than typically seen on maps of this period, with its northern borders extending well into the Gobi. In Southeast Asia and the East Indies the Straits of Sincapor (Singapore) are noted as is the empire of Siam or Thailand – which is shown to incorporate Laos and Cambodia.  Vietnam is divided between the northern and southern kingdoms of Tonkin and Cochin, respectively.  India is well mapped reflecting the work of Rennell and others in the region. The entire subcontinent is here shown to be attached to the vast Mogol Empire, which ruled from Delhi.  This curiosity suggests that Cruttwell referenced outdated sources, for by the late 18th century the British had conquered most of the region.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Batavia-cruttwell-1799,Antique Map: 1799 Clement Cruttwell Map of Holland or the Netherlands,Batavia or United Dutch States.,"A fine 1799 map of Batavia or the United Dutch States (the Netherlands) by the English map publisher Clement Cruttwell.  Map is highly detailed, with counties and municipalities outlined.  Of note on this particular map are the canals and dikes Cruttwell labeled.  These are extremely important to the country, as two thirds of the land is vulnerable to flooding.  River dikes prevent flooding from water flowing into the country by the major rivers Rhine and Meuse, while a system of drainage ditches, canals and pumping stations (windmills) keep the low lying parts dry for habitation and agriculture.  The Beemster, as Cruttwell notes in Northern Holland, was the first of these and was reclaimed from a lake, the water having been extracted by windmills.  He also labels what is known as the De Breeveertien (De Bree Veerthien) a large offshore shoal in the North Sea now home to an important wind farm.  In North Holland he identifies Zuyder Zee, which at this point in time was a shallow bay in the North Sea.  In the 20th century the majority of the Zuyder Zee was closed off and the salt water inlet changed into a fresh water lake called the Ijsselmeer (IJssel-lake), named thus after the river that drains into it.

Bishop’s pocket map of the city of Brooklyn, New York.  In the mid 19th century, fueled by the advent of the steam ferry, which made crossing the East River practical, Kings County experienced a massive population burst.  Wealthy and poor alike were quick to abandon the dirty and claustrophobic Manhattan for then suburban lands just across the East River.  In 1855 the communities of Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Bushwick and Williamsburg were consolidated by the State of New York into one large city, modern day Brooklyn.  It was around this time that the term “Kings County” began to fall out of popular usage in favor of “Brooklyn”.    By 1865, Brooklyn had become the third largest city in America, following New York and Philadelphia.  Here Brooklyn is revealed in the midst of this incredible development.  Prospect Park appears in all of its glory. Greenwood cemetery is shown with good interior detail.  The street layout, mimicking the grid system of Manhattan, is shown in considerable detail.  Attempts to detail important buildings, ferry crossings, bridges, train lines, and “plank roads.”  Also notes public buildings and lands such as the Lunatic Asylum, the Hospital, the Alms House, the Military Parade Grounds, the Marine Hospital and the Navy Yard.

Publisher:  The Office of the Coast Survey, founded in 1807 by Secretary of Commerce Albert Gallatin and President Thomas Jefferson, is the oldest organization of its kind in the U.S. Federal Government.   The hard working and daring agents of the U.S. Coast Survey were the first explorers to accurately map the North American coast line, opening the ports of the west to trading vessels from Europe, America and Asia.  Gallatin chose Swiss immigrant and West Point mathematics professor Ferdinand Hassler to direct the Coast Survey. Under the direction of Hassler, the Coast Survey developed a reputation for uncompromising dedication to the principles of accuracy and excellence.  Hassler lead the Coast Survey until his death in 1843, at which time Alexander Dallas Bache, a great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, took the helm.  Under the leadership A. D. Bache, the Coast Survey did most of its most important work.  During his Superintendence, Bache was steadfast advocate of American science and navigation and in fact founded the American Academy of Sciences.   The techniques developed by the United States Coast Survey were later used by the U.S. Geological and Geodetic Survey in the late 19th and early 20th century.",1852,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/andrews.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/StraitsofFlorida-andrews-1852.jpg,StraitsofFlorida-andrews-1852,34,27.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthPole-cruttwell-1799,Antique Map: 1799 Clement Cruttwell Map of North Pole,A Map of the Countries Thirty Degress Round the North Pole.,"A fine 1799 map of the northern polar regions by the English map publisher Clement Cruttwell.  Covers the polar regions from roughly 60 degrees north latitude to the North Pole.  Reveals a primitive yet ephemeral understanding of Arctic geography.    Evidence of the exploratory work of Tschirikow and Vitus Bering is clear in the northeast parts of Asia and Siberia.  However, the geography of North America across the Bering Straight is less clear with no significant inland detail and only a cursory nod to the important navigations of Cook.   The northern coastline from Greenland to Alaska is extremely vague with Baffin Bay being entirely enclosed and the northwestern coastland disappearing altogether.  Although not specifically named, Cruttwell marks the explorations of Herne along the Coppermine River and his sighting of the Coronation Gulf at roughly 70 degrees north latitude.  Cruttwell also notes but does not specifically reference the explorations of McKenzie northward from Great Salve Lake along the McKenzie River and his own important sighting of a great body of fresh water (probably Great Bear Lake) at roughly 70 degrees. Hearn and McKenzie's exploratory work finally ended the popular speculation that a northwest passage might be accessible from the Hudson Bay.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/UnitedStates-cruttwell-1799,Antique Map: 1799 Cruttwell Map of the United States of America,United States of America.,"This is a highly unusual and extremely scarce 1799 map of the United States by the English map publisher Clement Cruttwell.  Depicts a post-colonial pre-Louisiana United States extending from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic seaboard and from Florida to Canada. Though clearly based on Guthrie's c. 1780s map of the same title, this map offers a number of important innovations and updates that make this a significant cartographic piece in its own right.  This map exhibits a combinations of up to date cartographic information and references to mid 18th century colonial charters.   An excellent example is Pennsylvania's northern border which is drawn extending northward as far as Lake Ontario.  This rarely seen border configuration references an ambiguity in Pennsylvania's 1681 royal charter. The charter suggests that King Charles II intended to grant William Penn three full degrees of north-south latitude (about 180 miles).  This would put Pennsylvania's northern border at roughly 43° parallel, as shown here.  Shortly before this map was drawn the Pennsylvania and New York governments settled on 42° as Pennsylvania's northernmost border.  Clearly Cruttwell was relying on somewhat outdated information to construct his map.   Further north another interesting example is the additional territory of Sagahadok occupying much of modern day Maine's northern tier.  Sagahadok or Sagahadoc, is the legacy of an early 17th British effort to colonize North America. Technically Sagahadoc refers to the territory between the Kennebec River and Nova Scotia.  In the few mid 18th centurymaps that actually show Sagahadoc, such as Faden's map depicting the United States according to the 1784 Treaty of Paris, the region is depicted as a territory attached to the Massachusetts Colony.  However, by this time it has been fully separated from Massachusetts and is drawn as a separate colony.   The appearance of Sagahadoc may be related to a post Revolutionary War British attempt to add this part of northern Maine to their Nova Scotia Colony, referencing an early claim to the territory dating from its original failed 1620 colonization attempt. Similarly, Vermont, through clearly identified in its present location, is here added to British controlled Canada.   In the southwest a fledgling Kentucky appears with a northern border adhering to the Ohio River and a southern border encompassing much of today's Tennessee.  Though at this time there were many American Indian groups still active in Kentucky, including the Upper Cherokee and Tennessee tribe, most, with the incorporation of the state, were relocated south of the Tennessee River.   This is evident in the large unnamed territory extending as far south as West Florida and occupying much of what is today Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.  Within this region numerous American Indian nations are identified including the Tennessee, Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and others.   Along the Eastern seaboard Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia appear roughly in their current configuration though are clearly bounded on the west by the Appellation Mountains and, in the case of Georgia, the Flint River.  In the south, East and West Florida are at this time disputed territories passing back and forth between British and Spanish control.   The extreme northwest, comprising the vast territory  north of the Ohio River and west of Pennsylvania, including the Great Lakes, is identified as the Western Territory.  As with the unnamed territory  to the south of Kentucky, this northern region is largely dominated by American Indian tribes including the Sioux, Miami, Delaware, Saks, Chippewa, and others.  The Great Lakes themselves are riddled with errors including a number of apocryphal islands dating to Bellin's mid 18th century map of the territory.  These include Isle Philippeaux, Isle Ponchartrain, and several additional unnamed islands in Lake Superior.",1799 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/cruttwell.txt,"Cruttwell, C., <i>Atlas to Cruttwell's Gazetteer</i>, 1799.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/UnitedStates-cruttwell-1799.jpg,UnitedStates-cruttwell-1799,16,14

Eastern Hemisphere.,"A fine example of Clement Cruttwell's 1799 map of the world in two hemispheres.  This is an elegant world map designed to illustrate the activities of important explorers of the 17th and18th centuries.  The tracks of Cook, Anson, Bourgainville, Wallis, Furneaux, and others are noted.  Cook's work in the late 18th century, being of extreme importance, is emphasized.  Cartographically this  map follows established convention but does feature the most recent discoveries of Cook and Vitus Bering in the Arctic.  Inland detail is somewhat minimal and focuses on important cities and countries.  There are a few anomalies worthy of note.  Tasmania is attached to the Australian mainland.  The southern shores of New Guinea are unknown and left blank.  Japan is incorrectly aligned along the horizontal.  The Sea between Japan and Korea, the name of which is currently being disputed between Korea and  Japan, is here identified as the Sea of Corea. In North America the apocryphal River of the West runs from the west coast inland.  Also in North America, though the discoveries of Hearne are noted, the work of MacKenzie, further west, is missing (possibly Cruttwell was an investor in the Hudson Bay Company and didn't want to recognize the work of MacKenzie and the rival North West Company?).

The map extends from an internal roller mechanism in the top of the cane.  It is printed and hand colored on both sides.  The primary side shows the grounds of the Columbian Exposition, now Jackson Park and the Field Museum, naming all important buildings walks, pavilions, markets, etc.  Among the specific sites noted are Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show &amp; Congress of Rough Riders, the Chicago University Grounds, and  the various pavilions established for manufacturing, mining, transportation, liberal arts, agriculture, machinery, etc.  In the upper left quadrant there is a aerial view of the entire fair.    A larger inset along the right hand side of the map focuses on the Midway from Stony Island to Cottage Grove.  The 1893 Columbian Exposition or Chicago World's Fair was a pivotal moment in the history of the United States.  Chicago won the right to host the World's Fair over New York, Washington D.C., and St. Louis.   During its six month run, nearly 27,000,000 people, roughly half the population of the United States at the time, attended the fair.  Its numerous displays and exhibits established conventions for architecture, design, and decorative arts, in addition to initiating a new era of American industrial optimism.    The layout and design of the fair, as seen here, is the world of Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted, the genius behind New York City's Central Park.   Most of the fair was designed in the Beaux Arts tradition, a popular movement in Paris that was quickly gaining global momentum.  In the years following the fair, this influential architectural style redefined the cityscape of Chicago, Boston, New York, and many other prominent American cities.

Molokai.,"This rare and extraordinary 1897 map of the island of Molokai, in the Hawaiian group, was prepared for the 1906  Report of the Governor of the Territory of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior.  Though the cartographic work that produced this map was started in 1878, during the Hawaiian Monarchy, the map itself, and the report that contained it, was issued following the U.S. Government’s  1898 annexation of the Hawaiian Republic.  The Report was an attempt to assess and examine the newly created Hawaiian Territory’s potential for proper administration and development.   Consequently the map focuses on Public Lands, Homestead Settlement Tracts, Grazing Lands, Pineapple Lands, Sugar Plantations, Forest Reserves, Forest Lands, Wet Lands, etc.  It also features both practical and topographic details for use in administering the region.  At the turn of the century Molokai was has large cattle ranges and considerable grazing.  On the northern side of the island there is a six square mile leper colony.  The colony, home to about 100 people, was established in 1866 and was considered one of the most advanced institutions of its kind in existence. The Crown Lands, that is those belonging to  Kamehameha III, are depicted and drawn according to the divisions of 1848.  Today Molokai, due to its lack of sandy beaches, is considered the best preserved of its major islands. The governor of Hawaii at the time this chart was made was George R. Carter.  The primary triangulation for this map was accomplished by W.D. Alexander and M. D Monsarrat.   The topography by M. D Monsarrat.  And, the map itself was drawn by F. S. Dodge, C. J. Willis and S. M.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Roma-merian-1642,"Antique Map: 1652 Merian Panoramic View or Map of Rome, Italy",Roma.,"An important and stunning c. 1641 bird's eye view and map of Rome by Matthus Merian.   Merian's panoramic view of Rome, based on the eastward oriented model established in 1593 by Antonio Tempesta, reveals the city at the height of the Italian Renaissance.   This map follows shortly after Pope Sixtus the Fifth's ambitious civic redesign of Rome and yet predates the massive rebuilding that occurred during the Baroque Period, thus encapsulating the city during an ephemeral but significant period.  The axonometric projection that Merian utilizes lends this map a special significance to historians and architects who can thus visualize many buildings that were demolished or fell into ruin during the subsequent era.  The Column of Antononi the Pious, for example,   is depicted in its full glory, including its magnificent base. One might suppose, from 1703 excavation records, that most of the column, including the base, was buried in the 17th century, but here full knowledge of the column's form and design are evident - a mystery.  This map also includes some of the only surviving visual representations of Rome's early churches, many of which were replaced with grander structures in the 18th century.   Issued for inclusion in Matthuas Merian's 1642  Topographia Germaniae .  Though we can have no idea of how many of this map Merian originally printed, nor how many have survived to this day, we have identified roughly 21 examples in major institutional collections as well as, presumably, any number of additional examples in private hands.",1642 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/merian.txt,"Merian, M., <i>Topographia Germaniae</i>, 1642.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Roma-merian-1642.jpg,Roma-merian-1642,28.5,12.5
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Brooklyn-mccloskey-1866,"Antique Map: 1866 McCloskey's Pocket Map of Brooklyn, New York",Map of the Consolidated City of Brooklyn.,"An extremely rare later edition  of Henry McCloskey’s 1866 pocket map of the city of Brooklyn, New York.  In the mid 19th century, fueled by the advent of the steam ferry, which made crossing the East River practical, Kings County experienced a massive population burst.  Wealthy and poor alike were quick to abandon the dirty and claustrophobic Manhattan for then suburban lands just across the East River.  In 1855 the communities of Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Bushwick and Williamsburg were consolidated by the State of New York into one large city, modern day Brooklyn.  It was around this time that the term “Kings County” began to fall out of popular usage in favor of “Brooklyn”.    In 1866, when this map was printed, Brooklyn had become the third largest city in America, following New York and Philadelphia.  Here Brooklyn is revealed in the midst of this incredible development.  Prospect Park, which was still being built, is shown, as is Greenwood cemetery.  The street layout, mimicking the grid system of Manhattan, is shown in considerable detail.  The map attempts to detail important buildings, ferry crossings, bridges, train lines, and “plank roads.”  Also notes public buildings and lands such as the Lunatic Asylum, the Hospital, the Alms House, the Military Parade Grounds, the Marine Hospital and the Navy Yard.  Manhattan appears in the lower left hand corner of the map.    The title cartouche bears an engraving of Brooklyn’s City Hall.  This map was drawn by A. Brown of 47 Nassau Street, New York, for inclusion in Henry McCloskey’s 1866 Manual of the City and Corporation of Brooklyn.  Cartographically this map references and expands upon the 1846 map of Brooklyn surveyed and prepared by Richard Butt.

New York,"Without a doubt, one of the finest wall maps of Suffolk County, eastern Long Island, ever made.  This monumental 1858 wall map covers the eastern part of Long Island roughly from Huntington to Montauk.  Divided into two main sections, upper and lower.  The upper segment, mostly confined to the upper right quadrant, focuses on Huntington, Smithtown, Islip, and Brookhaven, including most of Fire Island and Oak Island.  The lower section, and the primary focus of the map as a whole, covers the eastern extension of Long Island including both forks, Brookhaven, Riverhead, Southampton, Southold, and East Hampton, as well as Gardiners Island and Shelter Island.  The upper left quadrants of the map as well as any empty zones in other sections are dedicated to detailed town plans.  These include Cold Spring, Amityville, Smith town, East Setauket, Patchogue, North Port, Babylon, Riverhead, Penataquit, Port Jefferson, Greenport, Sag Harbor, Southold, Bridgehampton, East Moriches, Millers Place, Comac, West Huntington, Bellport, Center Moriches, Mattituck, Aquebogue, Jamesport, New Suffolk, Stony Brook, East Marion, Orient, South ort, Amagansett, East Hampton, Sayville, Southampton and Cutchoge. The detail throughout is extraordinary, with Chase's survey work being, by far, the most accurate and in depth study of the region undertaken in the first half of the 19th century.  Chase notes roads, farms, bridges, and the individual family names of various properties.  In addition to noting property owners and important households, chase also includes business directories for the largest and most important towns.   There are additionally five engraved views including the Wyanbank House of Jeremiah Terry in Greenport, the residence of Stephen Haynes of Scuttle Hole, the Farmhouse of Elisha King of Good Ground, the Riverhead Courthouse, and the Summer Residence of  C. W. and J. T. Moore of Aquebogue.  The surveys for this map are the work of J. Chase Junior.

Depicts the Island of Manhattan north of 155th street including the districts of Inwood, Harlem, and Washington Heights.   The plan for much of Manhattan, south of 155th street, was originally laid out by John Randel in his 1811 Map of the City of New York or as it is otherwise known the “Comissioner’s Plan”.   This ambitions project transformed nearly 12,000 acres of wilderness into a massive urban grid.  Nonetheless, by 1860, New York City’s development had exceeded even Randel’s expectations.  The Central Park Commission was granted the responsibility of laying out the street system and public areas of the undeveloped parts of Manhattan northward of 155th street.  Consequently the 13th Annual Commissioner’s Report included this map which offers considerable detail regarding proposed street layouts, waterways, and public areas, both proposed and developed.  Also depicts the suggested bulkhead development extending the shoreline along both the eastern and western parts of Manhattan Island.

Measuring some 27 inches high and 260 inches long, this gigantic panoramic diagram charts the history of the world from a Biblical perspective, starting with the creation of Adam in 4004 B.C.  and ending in 1878 (though projected into the future as far as 1900).  Adams centers his chart  on the Stream of Time which is divided into decades and centuries.  Initially he simply follows the Bible's begats, but eventually he slowly segues into the historical period  with the development of Egyptian, Persian, and Greek culture.    He notes all  important events and offers historical and biblical commentary where appropriate - often illustrating historical monuments and Biblical events and monstrosities. Eventually the map gets necessarily more and more complicated as it passes into the classical era, the pre modern era, and ultimately the modern times.  At the end of the chart Adams shows the currently reigning world rulers, discusses the development of the United States, and even offers a breakdown of historically important technological developments.  Adams' also interestingly attempts to reconcile Biblical with Global history, associating for example, Noah, with Yao, a legendary figure in early Chinese mythology. This chart is so rich in detail and information that it is all but impossible to fully give it credit here, however, we encourage you to use the zoom engine above to thoroughly appreciate this remarkable document.    The amazing chart was drawn by Sebastian C. Adams of Salem, Oregon. This is the third edition, the first having been published in 1871.  The chart was published by A. H. Walker, a prominent European publisher with offices in London and Paris.  Printed in the United States by Strobridge &amp; Co, lithographers of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Herein Texas is depicted at its fullest extent including both Santa Fe and a northern extension encompassing the Green Mountains.   Drawn at the height of the California Gold Rush, this map responds to the international interest in the region by highlighting the gold fields in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valley.  The “Great Caravan Route” used by covered wagons during the westward expansion is also noted.  Tallis and Rapkin erroneously combine Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake -  a curious and uncommon mistake that is most likely merely and engravers blunder.  Upper California is surrounded by a green border, likely meant to communicate its transfer to the United States following the Treaty of Guadeloupe-Hidalgo, though such is not specifically noted anywhere on the map.  Similarly, Texas, though clearly separated from Mexico is not clearly part of the United States.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/World-delamarche-1859,Antique Map: 1859 Delamarche Case Map of the World,Nouvelle Carte Universelle Du Monde.,"A fine example of Felix Delamarche's 1859 case map off the World.  Drawn on a monumental scale, this incredible map covers the known world, from the Arctic Icecap to the just discovered Terres Australes (Antarctica).    The map purports to be based upon nautical charts and the most recent marine documents available.  Cartographically it reflects some of the most recent discoveries, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctic - for which the 19th century world had a particular fascination.   In addition to the standard cartographic elements, Delamarche has added a host of additional information including cultural notes on the peoples and places depicted and no less than seventeen illustrative vignettes.  Some of these include prospectors panning gold in California, a large illustration of arctic explorers besieged by angry polar bears, the Great Wall of China, the Falls of Niagara, a Micronesian House, and the Amazon Rain Forest, among others.  Tabular data at the base of the map showcases the distances of the worlds capitals form Paris, the lengths of the world's great rivers, the heights of mountains, and a timetable of discovery.  Engraved by Felix Delamarche of 45 Rue St. Andre des Arts, Paris for B. Renault and Company, 46 Rue D'Ulm, Pairs.  As a whole this map is an exemplar of a mapping style developed in France during the mid 19th century.  Though not properly recognized, this style is marked by a number of cartographic conventions.  European, particularly French, map publishers of the period started to take advantage of the sophisticated lithographic techniques being developed at the time.  Able to economically print highly detailed maps on a massive scale, French cartographers began illustrating their maps with numerous decorative views and other engravings.    Though the inclusion of pictorial elements in maps was nothing new, the style is distinguished from earlier cartographic graphics by its intent.  In the 18th century graphic elements tended to be either purely decorative or allegorical.  By the early 19th century, through the influence of the comparatively minimalist English cartographic traditions of Cary, Pinkerton and Thomson,  graphic illustrations had all but vanished from maps.  With the birth of the arm chair explorer in the mid-19th century, illustrative images once again began working their way into maps.  These new illustrations however,  were pictorial and intended to illustrate natural wonders, foreign cultures, and exotic animals. Examples of this style include the  Illustrated Atlas  of  Englishman John Tallis and, more commonly, the cartography of the French tradition exemplified by Levassuer, Vuillemin, Delamarche.",1859 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/delamarche.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/World-delamarche-1859.jpg,World-delamarche-1859,44,31

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/LevenworthGreatSaltLake2-stansbury-1852,"Antique Map: 1852 Stansbury Map of the Great Salt Lake to Fort Levenworth Route (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas)","Map of a Reconnoissance between Fort Levenworth and the Missouri River, and the Great Salt Lake in the Territory of Utah, made in 1849 and 1850 …","It had been a daring feat of exploration, succeeding where the mountain men had all failed, and by means of his map ... Stansbury had painted at least one more bold stroke into the unfinished portrait of the national landscape.     - William Goetzmann This monumental map details Stansbury's seminal 1852 trek from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to the Great Salt Lake region of Utah.  It is considered to be the first accurate survey of the Great Basin and the southern Rocky Mountains, as well as a cornerstone achievement in the mapping of the American West.  The first westerner to visit the Great Basin was most likely Silvestre Vélez de Escalante in the 1776, however, Escalante, who visited Utah Lake to the south, never truly laid eyes on Great Salt Lake.  That honor would fall to unnamed trappers and mountain men traveling the region in search of furs and other tradable commodities.  Unfortunately, few  of these were literate.  The first scientific expedition to this area was headed up by Fremont in 1843.  Daunted by the season and climate, Fremont never circumnavigated the lake.  That task fell to Howard Stansbury who, in 1849, was assigned by Congress to survey the Great Salt Lake, the Utah Valley, and the emigrant roads passing through the region.  Stansbury, working with Gunnison, Carrington, and others, took about two years to complete their survey before presenting it to Congress in 1852.  This map was part of that presentation.  Covering the region from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to the Great Basin, Utah, Sansbury's map is the result of a monumental feat of exploration and scientific tenacity.   Includes the modern day states of Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.  The detail throughout is extraordinary, identifying springs, rivers, passes, important buildings, American Indian settlements, canals, etc.  Stansbury's work and this map are responsible for creating much of the region's nomenclature, but where it is not, both Mormon and American Indian names are provided.  This is also one of the earliest maps to delineate the street grid of Salt Lake City.  As much as possible, Stansbury attempts to provide useful information for the traveler.  He notes the campsites where his team rested and offers dates for each.  Both the Emigrant Road from California (passing north of the lake) and the Road From California (Passing South of the Lake) are shown.  He also provides useful notations, such as this one just to the left of Great Salt Lake This desert consists of clay and sand impregnated with salt. When wet, it has the consistency of mortar. Lightly loaded wagons can pass between Spring Valley and Pilot Peak in the driest part of the season. Forage and water must be carried for cattle, and the journey begun in the P. M. and continued through the night. Distance between springs 70 ms. .  Stansbury also provides considerable with regard to the Rocky Mountains (Colorado and Wyoming), noting South Park, Middle Park, and North Park as well as Pikes Peak, Longs Peak, Laramie Peak, and others.  This map details the whole of Stansbury's 1849 to 1850 journey.  A year after his return, it was presented in Washington and received with great  acclaim. Gunnison, Stansbury's second,  was commissioned to return to the region the next  year in order to survey a viable route for the Pacific Railroad.  In the process of completing this project, Gunnison fell afoul of the local Ute (Utah) Indians, who killed him and several other members of his party in an ambush, delaying the survey and the development of the Pacific Railroad for a number of years.   Drawn by H. Gunnison and C. Pruss.  Published in 1852 as part of the  Stansbury Report , which was presented to congress in that same year.

This highly uncommon map, the earliest known example of which was issued in 1867, is considered to be the only pocket map of Florida actually printed in Florida.  The first edition of this map was printed by Columbus Drew from his offices in Jacksonville Florida and subsequently updated in an unknown number of editions into the 1880s.  This example was printed by Horace Drew, son and successor to Columbus. It reflects the rapid and hopeful development of Florida through the middle and late 19 century, with numerous railways, roads, and canals noted.    Of particular note is the Lucie Canal, shown here leading from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.  This canal was part of a plan, supported by Drew, to drain the Everglades via a series of well placed water channels.  Fortunately the Lucie canal was never built and the unique Everglades biosphere has been preserved for us to enjoy today.    Also of interest is the extensive notation in the lower left quadrant regarding the Florida Land Survey.  Even in the late 19th century much of Florida remained federally administrated Public Land.  It was the work of the Florida Land Survey, upon which this map is based, to plat out the land for sale to settlers.  Drew's notations explain the process and how do identify land available for purchase.  Drew additionally notes the sites of various important battles during the Seminole Wars.   Considered the Holy Grail of 19th century Florida cartography, this map is a must for any serious collection focusing on the American Southeast.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/CaspianKamchatka-homann-1725,Antique Map: 1725 Homann Map of the Caspian Sea and Kamchatka (as Yedso),"Geographica Nova ex Oriente Gratiosissima, Duabus Tabulis Special. contenta, quarum Una Mare Caspium, Altera Kamtzadaliam, seu Terram Jedso.","One of Homann's most interesting and influential maps, this 1725 map depicts the Caspian Sea and the Peninsula of Kamchatka.   Essentially two maps in one, Homann here juxtaposes two opposite parts of Asia:  the Capsian Sea, which forms part the western border of Asia and Europe, and the Peninsula of Kamchatka, the easternmost known point in continental Asia.  While this combination may seem odd to us today, to the 18th century European, reared on the works of Marco Polo and steeped in the legends of wealth associated with the orient, it represented the legendary Silk Route across Asia as well as the eastern and western most claims of the expanding Russian Empire.  During this period, both the Caspian Sea and Kamchatka were actively being explored by European powers eager to exploit the riches of Asia.   The left hand map, focusing on the Caspian Sea, marks a significant step forward in the mapping of this region, reflecting the 1719 - 1721 survey work of the Russian navy officer Karl van Verden.  Verden's work, completed shortly before this map's publication was the most advanced mapping of the Caspian sea to date, offering a new perspective on the region and opening the navigational possibility of the world's largest lake.   The right hand map depicts Kamchatka.  Though only tentatively explored at this point, Russian forces under Vladimir Alassov took control of the peninsula in 1697.  In the process they stumbled upon a small colony of Japanese shipwreck survivors, a discovery that lead the Russians to speculate that Kamchatka was one and the same with Yedso (Jedo or modern day Hokkaido), the northernmost part of Japan.  Homann's timely map of the region thus had a significant impact on subsequent cartography of the region.  Most importantly Homann's map influenced Engelbert Kaempfer's 1727  History of Japan  which laid the ground work for European cartographic representations of Japan for the next 50 to 60 years.   Subsequent maps of Japan would incorporate the mythical island of Matsumai (shown here as Matmanska) into a small archipelago joining Japan to Kamchatka - thus placing part of the prized Japanese island chain in the sphere of Russian, hence European, influence.   East of Kamchatka there appear two large bodies of land.  These mythical landmasses reflect speculation associated with the connections between Northeastern Asia and Northwestern America.  Many early maps incorporated these islands, often called Compagnie Land, Terre de Compagnie, Gamaland, or just Gama.  Though not labeled as such on this map, there is no doubt this land is what Homann is attempting to represent.  Compagnie was supposedly discovered  by the mysterious sailor Jean de Gama in the 17th century.  Most likely this territory is, like Muller's Peninsula, merely a misinterpretation of numerous sightings of the various Aleutian Islands.   The two primary panels of this map are separated by an unusual band of allegorical cartouche work.  From on high the sun gazes down upon the lands of men and gods - much as the cartographer might have imagined himself looking down upon the world.  Cherubs, angels, and cosmic figures hold aloft the instruments of cartography.  At the base of the cartouche a man sits next to a globe, his mapping tools at hand.  The globe itself is set to Asia with both the Caspian Sea and Kamchatka set recognizably in context.  One of the most interesting elements of this cartouche is the small map of Japan being held by a child in the lower right.  Though tiny and a seeming minor element, this little map is actually the first of a serious of important representations of Japan in which the Noto Peninsula is turned westward.  This cartographic convention did not begin to appear in actual maps until Bellin's 1736 mapping of Japan.",1725 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/homann.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CaspianKamchatka-homann-1725.jpg,CaspianKamchatka-homann-1725,23,20

A View of Collect Pond and Its Vicinity in the City of New York in 1793""","An extremely scarce 1846 broadside issued by John Hutchings to promote the awareness of John Fitch as a pioneer of steam navigation.  Fitch was an instrument maker working in the later part of the 18th century.  As an early pioneer of steam navigation, Fitch tested several steamboats on the Delaware River between 1785 and 1788.  One of these, the Perseverance, is depicted in the upper right quadrant of this sheet.  Fitch’s real success, however, occurred a few years later when, in 1793 he tested  another ship equipped with a paddle wheel on New York’s Collect Pond.  This was a full six years before Fulton and Livingston launched “Fulton’s Folly” on the Seine.   Hutchings claims to have been a “lad” at the time who “assisted Mr. Fitch in steering the boat”.  Hutchings asserts that it was in fact Fitch who designed the steam propulsion mechanism. He claims that both Fulton and Livingston were present during the Collect Pond tests and in fact depicts both, as well as Fitch and himself, in a paddlewheel steam ship in the upper left quadrant.   Though Fulton seems to have received most of the credit for the era of steam navigation, Hutchings hoped, through the publication of this broadside, to shed some light on Fitch’s contributions as well.    Central to this publication is a map of the Collect Pond and vicinity extending roughly from Broadway westward to Chatam Street, south as far as City Hall Park and north to Canal.  Roughly between Barlet Street and Franklin rested the Collect Pond, a natural depression and drainage area that filled with water seasonally.  The Collect Pond appears in early maps of New York City and until the construction of the Croton Aqueduct was one of the few sources of fresh water in lower Manhattan.  This pond was filled in around 1811 when it transformed  into the notorious and poverty stricken Five Points district. When Fitch tested his steamboat the pond would have been surrounded by slaughterhouses, tanneries, gunpowder storage, bogs and prisons – not exactly a pretty place for an afternoon boat ride.  The map image is surrounded by a brief biography of Fitch, signed attestations from important figures regarding the character of Fitch and Hutchings, and eye-witness accounts of the events in question.  Right of the map is a description, written by Hutchings, describing the event and the Collect Pond vessel itself.

Essentially depicts the north eastern parts of Asia, speculations on northwestern America, and Admiral De Fonte’s mythical conception of a Northwest Passage.   Heavily based upon earlier work by Thomas Jefferys, Thomas Swaine Drage, Gerhard Muller, and James De Lisle.   Vaugondy prepared this map prior to the voyages of James Cook to this region.   Around this time Europe was rampant with speculation both regarding the existence of a Northwest Passage and the northwestern parts of America in general.   The discoveries of Admiral de Fonte and Juan de Fuca though now known to be entirely mythical, inspired the European imagination.    Barthlomew de Fonte was supposedly a Spanish Admiral who, sailing up the Pacific coast c. 1640 discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward towards the Hudson Bay.  Supposedly, upon one of these great inland lakes, he met with a ship from Boston that claimed to have come through a Northwestern Passage.  De Fonte’s story appeared in a short lived 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”.  The story inspired no less than Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle, younger brother of the better known Guilleme de L’Isle.  Joseph-Nicholas, at the time, was employed by the Russian Tzar Peter the Great in the compilation of Russian surveys and discoveries in Siberia and the extreme northeast of Asia.  When he published his somewhat accurate map of northeast Asia, he paradoxically decided to include with it an entirely speculative map of North America based largely on De Fonte’s letter.  De L’Isle’s mantle was later taken up by Jefferys, another ardent supporter of the De Fonte Northwest Passage theory, in his own map of the region, which was, ultimately, the inspiration for this map by Vaugondy.  In accord with De Fonte’s suggestions  this map displays the strait of Juan de Fuca continuing inland  past the large lakes of Velasco, Belle and De Fonte to communicate with the Baffin and Hudson Bay.  There are also a series of rivers and waterways connecting the lakes themselves to an outlet in the Arctic.  Based upon Russian reports, Vaugondy renames the “Straits of Ainan”, the “Detroit de Bering”, paying homage to the great Russian navigator.  Anian itself has been moved southward nearer to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Anian is a term derived from a John Donne poem, “Anyan if I go west by the North-West passage.” However, it was interpreted as the Bering Strait by cartographers, successfully transitioning it from the realms of poetry to cartography.  Anian presupposed the existence of a Northwest Passage and, as such, was entirely mythical, though the lands that are now Alaska long bore that name. Further south still we find Quivira, one of the legendary northern American Kingdoms of Gold.  Nearer to Russia the Aleutian Islands have been consolidated into a large peninsular landmass extending eastward towards Asia.  In the extreme north, between 80 and 60 degrees of latitude is an archipelago, presumably discovered by Japanese sailors marooned in Kamtschatka, and purportedly inhabited entirely by pigmies.  An altogether fascinating map of the Northwest Passage and the American west and a must for any serious collection dedicated to this region.

These include the governments of Archangel, Vologda, Upha, Caucasus, and Saratov in the west.  The most notable, however, are the Governements of Tobolsk and Irkutsk in central Russia.  Tobolsk is the historic capital of Siberia, and is now part of current day Tyumen Oblast.  After administrative division of the territory, Tobolsk remained the seat of the Governor-General of Western Siberia until the seat was moved to Omsk in the 1820s or 1830s. Bowing to the city's authority, many Siberian towns, including Omsk, Tyumen, and Tomsk, had their original arms display the Tobolsk insignia.  Irkutsk is currently the largest city in Siberia and is presently the administrative center of the Irkutsk Oblast.  In 1760 the Siberian Road was built connecting Irkutsk to Moscow, and it was at this point the city flourished economically, becoming a major trading hub.

Printed during the French Revolution - an 6 de la Republique. Covers from Paris in the west to Sarre-Louis in the east, from Rocroi in the north to Avallon in the south.  Includes the full extent of the Champagne district.  Printed on four sheets, the northern two of which are joined as a set, as are the southern two.  Depicts the region in incredible detail showing roads, canals, rivers, cities, fortresses, villages, chateaux, etc. The region outside of Champagne proper is less detailed, but still offers a wealth of cartographic information and includes the important centers of Paris, Orleans and Beauvais.    Champagne is famous around the world for its spectacular sparkling wines of the same name. Historically the province of Champagne was bounded on the north by the bishopric of Liège and by Luxembourg, on the east by Lorraine, on the south by Burgundy, and on the west by Îlele-de-France, and by Picardy. Along with the other original French provinces, Champagne was abolished as a separate entity in 1790.  Today this region consists of five départements: Aisne, Aube, Haute-Marne, Marne, and Seine-et-Marne. The towns of Troyes (capital of Champagne), Reims and Épernay are the commercial and government centers. A fabulous decorative piece for perfect for wine store, Champagne wine cellars, and French restaurants.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthPole-mercator-1606,Antique Map: 1606 Mercator Hondius Map of the Arctic (First Map of the North Pole),Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.,"This is the second edition of Gerard Mercator's map of the North Pole or Arctic, one of the great cartographer's most interesting and important maps.  Mercator's Arctic projection has its roots in his magnificent 1569 wall map of the world in which Mercator first introduces his revolutionary projection.  As regards the Arctic, the difficulty with the Mercator Projection is that to accurately depict the Polar Regions,  his map would have to be infinitely tall.  Mercator compensated for this by included a polar projection, very similar to the map shown here, in the lower-left hand corner of his great map.  This may rightly be considered to be the world's first specific map of the north pole.  Mercator later reissued this map in an expanded format for his 1595 atlas.  Following a number of important expeditions to the Arctic in subsequent 10 years, Mercator's successor Jodocus Hondius reissued the original 1595 map with a number of revolutionary and highly  significant changes.  Our survey of this map must naturally being with the North Pole itself which Mercator envisions as a large black rock, the  Rupes Nigra , surrounded by a great whirlpool into which four powerful rapid rivers flow. These rivers divide a massive continent sized landmass into four distinct islands or countries.  When the English polymath John Dee wrote to Mercator asking about his sources for this map, Mercator returned the following letter which survives in his own hand:  In the midst of the four countries is a Whirl-pool, into which there empty these four indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the Earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel. It is four degrees wide on every side of the Pole, that is to say eight degrees altogether. Except that right under the Pole there lies a bare Rock in the midst of the Sea. Its circumference is almost 33 French miles, and it is all of magnetic Stone (…) This is word for word everything that I copied out of this author years ago.  The author that Mercator refers to is generally believed be Jocobus Cnoyen van Herzogenbusch who is himself referencing an enigmatic lost work, the  Inventio Fortunata .  Little is known of the  Inventio Fortunata  (Fortunate Discoveries) save that it was composed in the 14th century and was a well known resource for cartographers of the 15th and 16th centuries.  The author of this work is a figure of considerable mystery and arguments have been made that he is Nicholas of Lynn, Thomas Kingsbury, or Hugh of Ireland.  The work tells of a Minorite monk from Oxford who traveled extensively in northern lands, including Iceland, Greenland, Norway, and possibly even Labrador.  The  Inventio Fortunata  also itself references a far older and similarly lost work, the  Gestae Arthuri , which adds a new chapter to the legend of King Author, citing that his warriors conquered Iceland, Greenland, the Faroes, and parts of Norway.  Regardless of the attribution of Mercator's sources, the idea of the Arctic being divided into four lands surrounding a black magnetic rock was, even in the 16th century, not new.  Variants on the magnetic rock them, the  Rupes Nigra , can be found in such esteemed references such as the texts of Ptolemy, which identifies sever such.  The presence of such a magnetic mountain at the extreme north may have seemed a natural connection for scholars attempting to explain the wonders of the compass.  Curiously, though referencing the  Inventio Fortunata  with regard to the presence of the  Rupes Nigra  at the Arctic Pole, Mercator does not ascribe to it any magnetic property.",1606 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/mercator.txt,"Mercator, G. and Hondius, J, <i>Atlas</i>, 1606.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NorthPole-mercator-1606.jpg,NorthPole-mercator-1606,16,15

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SouthernAfrica-pinkerton-1809,Antique Map: 1809 Pinkerton Map of Southern Africa,Southern Africa.,"This fascinating hand colored 1809 map by Edinburgh cartographer John Pinkerton depicts Southern Africa. Covers Africa from Angola south to the Cape Colony (modern South Africa) and east to the Kingdom of Mongall (modern day Mozambique) and the island of Madagascar.  Reflecting the somewhat limited knowledge of the African interior available to European cartographers of the period, only three areas are illustrated with any detail - the Congo, the Cape Colony (South Africa) and the former Kingdom of Monomotapa, which roughly overlaps modern day Mozambique.     The Congo had been actively mapped and exploited by Portuguese merchants as early as the 14th century.  South Africa, similarly, had an active Dutch and English presence since the earliest days of African Colonization.   The ancient Kingdom of Monomotapa, here part of the Empire of the Bororos and divided into Sabia, Sofala, Munhay and Manica, appears on most early maps of Africa.  Already a great trading Empire when Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape of Good hope in the 1490s, Monomotapa or the regions between the Sabia, Sofala and Zambezi River systems, had long been associated with legends of King Solomon's Mines and the Biblical lands of Ophir.  In the 15th century the Zambezi hills were indeed rich in gold, but these deposits had run out by the 1600s.  Still, the European imagination, inflamed by conquistador tales of golden empires in America, made several attempts to conquer the region, only to find that there was no more gold to be had.  In other areas of Africa's interior Pinkerton notes an embryonic Lake Malawi (named Maravi), and notes several important African tribal nations, including the Massai, the Hottentots, the Bembe, and the Luba (Lubolo).",1809 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/pinkerton.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/SouthernAfrica-pinkerton-1809.jpg,SouthernAfrica-pinkerton-1809,28,20.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/GreatSaltLake2-stansbury-1852,Antique Map: 1852 Stansbury Map of Utah and the Great Salt Lake,Map of the Great Salt Lake and Adjacent Country in the Territory of Utah.,"It had been a daring feat of exploration, succeeding where the mountain men had all failed, and by means of his map of the western portion of the lake, Stansbury had painted at least one more bold stroke into the unfinished portrait of the national landscape.     - William Goetzmann This is Stansbury's seminal 1852 map of the Great Salt Lake region in Utah.  It is considered to be the first accurate survey of the Great Basin as well as a cornerstone achievement in the mapping of the American West.  The first westerner to visit the Great Basin was most likely Silvestre Vélez de Escalante in the 1776, however, Escalante, who visited Utah Lake to the south, never truly laid eyes on Great Salt Lake.  That honor would fall to unnamed trappers and mountain men traveling the region in search of furs and other tradable commodities.  Unfortunately, few of these men were literate and did not record their discoveries.  The first scientific expedition to this area was headed up by Fremont in 1843.  Daunted by the season and climate, Fremont never circumnavigated the lake.  That task fell to Howard Stansbury who, in 1849, was assigned by Congress to survey the Great Salt Lake, the Utah Valley, and the emigrant roads passing through the region.  Stansbury, working with Gunnison, Carrington, and others, took about two years to complete his survey before presenting it to Congress in 1852.  This map was part of that presentation.  Covering the region of the Great Basin from the Bear River in the north to Mount Nebo in the south, and from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Great Plains in the east, Sansbury's map is the result of a monumental feat of exploration and scientific tenacity.  The detail throughout is extraordinary, identifying springs, rivers, passes, important buildings, American Indian settlements, canals, etc.  Stansbury's work and this map are responsible for creating much of the region's nomenclature, but where it is not, both Mormon and American Indian names are provided.  This is also one of the earliest maps to delineate the street plan of Salt Lake City.  Stansbury attempts to provide useful information for the traveler.  Both the Emigrant Road from California (passing north of the lake) and the Road From California (Passing South of the Lake) are shown.  He also provides useful notations for the traveler, such as this one in the lower left quadrant This desert consists of clay and sand impregnated with salt. When wet, it has the consistency of mortar. Lightly loaded wagons can pass between Spring Valley and Pilot Peak in the driest part of the season. Forage and water must be carried for cattle, and the journey begun in the P. M. and continued through the night. Distance between springs 70 ms. .  As much as possible, Stansbury includes nautical details and depth sounding for both Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake.  In the process of creating a marine survey of the Lake, the Stansbury team was also the first to identify and  chart  many of Great Salt Lake's Islands ,as might be deduced form their names: Stansbury Island, Carrington Island, Gunnison Island, and Fremont Island.  Wheat, in his classic study of American exploration,  Mapping the Transmississippi West , devotes  considerable attention to this important map,   Obviously a major production...an illuminating map of Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, their respective valleys, and a portion of ‘Youab’ (Juab) Valley to the south.... This map permanently established the cartography and many place names of northwestern Utah.... One of its most attractive features is that it gives the Indian as well as the Mormon names of the various creeks draining from the mountains. For Great Salt Lake itself the map was definitive, of course, permanent names being given to all the islands and shoreline features....",1852 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/stansbury.txt,"Stansbury, H.

Sanson Geographe Ordinaire du Roy.","An extraordinary map of monumental proportions, this Sanson and Jaillot's c.1691 decorative map of the world on a double hemisphere projection.  Covers the entire world according to its 17th century conception. Elaborate allegorical cartouches appear at top center and bottom center detailing cherubs riding dolphins - the symbols of the Dauphin of France.    Our survey of this map will begin  in North America where California is depicted as an island.  The idea of an insular California first appeared as a work of fiction in Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo's c. 1510 romance  Las Sergas de Esplandian , where he writes  Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons. Baja California was subsequently discovered in 1533 by Fortun Ximenez, who had been sent to the area by Hernan Cortez.  When Cortez himself traveled to Baja, he must have had Montalvo's novel in mind, for he immediately claimed the Island of California for the King.  By the late 16th and early 17th century ample evidence had been amassed, through explorations of the region by Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcon and others, that California was in fact a peninsula.  However, by this time other factors were in play.  Francis Drake had sailed north and claimed New Albion near modern day Washington or Vancouver for England.  The Spanish thus needed to promote Cortez's claim on the Island of California to preempt English claims on the western coast  of North America.  The significant influence of the Spanish crown on European cartographers caused a major resurgence of the Insular California theory, of which Sanson was a primary proponent.  Shortly after this map was made Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, traveled overland from Mexico to California, proving conclusively the peninsularity of California.   Traveling northwest, away from the mainland, we come across a land labeled Terre de Jesso or  Je Co. or Terre de la Compagnie.  Though Yesso or Jesso is a name usually associated with Hokkaido (which here is drawn as part of mainland Asia), this land mass is more commonly called Gama or Gamaland.  Gama was supposedly discovered in the 17th century by a mysterious figure known as Jean de Gama. Various subsequent navigators claim to have seen this land and it appeared in  numerous maps well into the late 18th century.   At times it was associated with Hokkaido, in Japan, and at other times with the mainland of North America.  On this map we are struck by its uncanny resemblance to Gerhard Muller's peninsula which emerged in the late 18th century. Based on numerous sightings but no significant exploration of the Aleutian Islands, Muller postulated that the archipelago was in fact a single land mass.  This he mapped extending from the North American mainland towards Asia much as the Terre de Compagnie does on this map.  It is not inconceivable that navigators sailing in the northern seas from Asia could have made this same error in the 16th and 17th centuries.   Moving east of California into the North American mainland we find ourselves in the Spanish colony of New Mexico.  Santa Fe, its capital, had been founded in 1610 and here we find it situated far to the north of its actual location, on the Colorado (Rio Norte) rather than the Rio Grande or Santa Fe River.

Covers modern day Russia and the Ukraine from the Arctic to the Crimea and as far east as the Caspian Sea.  Interest in this area peaked in Western Europe following the discoveries of Barentz, Hudson, and others in Russian Arctic which lead to the founding of the Muscovy Company in 1555.   Traders, mostly English and Dutch, discovered they could access the wealth of Eastern and Central Asia by traveling  south of Nova Zembla to the Karo Sea, then south some 600 miles by river to Moscow.   At this time the Russian Tzar did not yet have access to the Baltic and consequently was at the mercy of the Hanseatic League, which controlled much of the region's trade.  The opening of an Arctic route to Russia and the foundation of the Muscovy Company generated enormous wealth for the princes of Russia, eventually bringing the country into the fold of the western European community.  Essentially a Ptolemaic style projection, this map was engraved by Girolamo Porro and published as part of Ruscelli's Italian translation of Ptolemy's  Geographia .

It is an early and historically important representation of the continent of Africa.  Much of the continent is simply labeled “unknown parts”.  Those sections that are known are surprisingly detailed.   Caravan routes, temples, and even the distances between Oases are generally noted.  Across the center of the continent Thomson details the mythical mountain range known as the “Mountains of the Moon”.  The mountains of the moon were first postulated by Ptolemy to be the source of the Nile.  This mysterious range remained on maps until the mid 19th century explorations of Burton, Speke, and Livingstone.  Today it is generally agreed that references to the Mountains of the Moon refer to the Ruwenzori Range of Kenya &amp; Uganda.  This mountain range remains one of the most remote and exotic places on Earth, and is the home of a diversity of bizarre plant and animal life.  However, it is not, as postulated, the source of the Nile which lies just to the south in Lake Victoria.  Neither Lake Victoria nor Lake Tanganyika, which appear in much earlier Bleau maps, appear on this map.  Thomson maps are known for their stunning color, awe inspiring size, and magnificent detail.

The Burakumin are a social minority group labeled as “outcasts” under old Japanese caste system. This system, which dates to the early days of the feudal shogun era, identified the Burakumin as “untouchable” due to their employment in death related professions such as gravediggers, undertakers, embalmers and leather workers. Burakumin were believed to have been “tainted by death” and thus unlucky.

Issued by Brion de la Tour in 1777, this map was intended to illustrate the important events at the height of the American Revolutionary War.  Brion’s map covers from the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays northward as far as Quebec City, inclusive of New York (with modern day Vermont), New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Maine and Canada. Shows both political and topographical detail including mountains, rivers, roadways, regional boundaries, American Indian nations, towns, and cities.  The significance of this map stems not only from its sophisticated cartographic representation of the region, but also for its notations regarding the October 16th Battle of Saratoga and the subsequent surrender of the British Army of General John Burgoyne. Considered to be the major turning point in the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Saratoga was precipitated when General Burgoyne led a large force of British and German soldiers through parts of New York and New England with the intention of dividing New England from the southern theater of war.  In a series of strategic maneuvers American soldiers under Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold (before he changed sides) surrounded Burgoyne at Saratoga, forcing his surrender.  This event, beautifully illustrated in this French map of the area, convinced the French King Louis XV to officially support the American Revolutionary efforts.  By joining the Revolutionary War on the side of the Americans, the French and later the Spanish, turned the war from an internal matter between Britain and its colonies into a global conflict.  Several editions of this map appeared in 1777, 1778, 1779 and in a reduced size in 1782.  This edition, the first, is considered the most important, valuable, and desirable.  This map is the first published illustration of the Battle of Saratoga to appear in France and responded directly to French interest in the American Revolutionary War associated with their subsequent involvement.  Though most known examples exhibit a centerfold, like this one, Brion’s map of the Theater of War in America was a separate issue and not associated with any specific publication.  Drawn by Brion de La Tour and published by Esnauts et Rapilly from their on Rue St. Jacques a la Ville de Coutances.   Scale 1:1,200,000.

Depicts the park as a whole and includes pathways, lakes, buildings, individual trees, rocks, and elevation measurements. The streets and avenues surrounding the park are labeled as are the various landmarks of Central Park – the Knoll, The Ramble, the Mall, and some 55 others.  This extraordinary map reveals Central Park as conceived by the Landscape Architects, and indeed “artists”, Vaux and Olmstead.  Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council.  Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park.  The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design.  The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned.  Olmstead wrote:   “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”   Historian Gloria Deak writes,  “There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’”  Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privilege of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban  public recreation area in the world.",1866,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/unknown.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CentralParkGuide-mcny-1869.jpg,CentralParkGuide-mcny-1869,16,7

This rare map covers from the southern shores of Kyushu south along the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa) to Taiwan and the coastline of mainland China. The powerful Satsuma Daimyo, which flourished and enjoyed special privileges under the Tokugawa Shoguns, controlled much of the territory shown here.  What is most remarkable about this piece is that knowledge of this region would have been very rare and restricted information during under the Tokugawa era Kaikin system of national isolation. Despite the isolationist policy, limited trade and information exchange did exist. One of the unique privileges associated with Satsuma control of the Ryukyu Islands was greater independence and freedom of foreign trade than most of Edo period daimyo were permitted.  Consequently Satsuma trading vessels regularly traveled to Taiwan and mainland China thus acting as one of isolationist Japan’s few links to the outside world.  This chart can be best understood in this context – as a rare glimpse of Satsuma's nautical trade routes between Kyushu, Taiwan, and mainland China. Later in the Meiji period, the wealth, power, and international sophistication of the Satsuma Daimyo would have a significant influence on the Meiji Ishin or Meiji Restoration.

Babr. Doppelmajero Math. P.P. upera Joh. Baptistae Homanni Norinbergae.,"A stunning full color example of J. B. Homann and Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr’s important c. 1742 map of the Moon.    Essentially a comparative chart, Doppelmayer constructed this map to illustrate the lunar mapping of Johannes Hevelius (left) and Giovanni Battista Riccioli (right).    The left hand lunar map, composed by Hevelius, is a considered a foundational map in the science of Selenography – or lunar cartography.  This map first appeared in Hevelius’ 1647 work  Selenographia  which laid the groundwork for most subsequent lunar cartographic studies.  Here the moon is presented as it can never be seen from Earth, at a greater than 360 degrees and with all visible features given equal weight.  In this map Hevelius also establishes the convention of mapping the lunar surface as if illuminated from a single source – in this case morning light.  The naming conventions he set forth, which associate lunar features with terrestrial locations such as “Asia Minor”, “Persia”, “Sicilia”, and etcetera were popular until the middle of the 18th century when Riccioli’s nomenclature took precedence.   The Riccioli map, on the right, is more properly known as the Riccioli-Grimaldi map, for the fellow Jesuit Francesco Grimaldi with whom Riccioli composed the chart.  This map first appeared in Riccioli and Grimaldi’s 1651  Almagestum Novum . This was a significant lunar chart and offered an entirely new nomenclature which, for the most part, is still in use today.  Curiously, though Riccioli, as a devout Jesuit, composed several treatises denouncing Copernican theory, he chose to name one of the Moon’s most notable features after the astronomer – perhaps suggesting that he was a secret Copernicus sympathizer?  Other well-known lunar features named by Riccioli include the Sea of Tranquility where Apollo 11 landed and where Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon’s surface.   The upper left and right hand quadrants feature decorative allegorical cartouche work that include images of angelic children looking through a telescope and a representation of the ancient Greek Moon goddess Selene.  Additional mini-maps show the moon in various phases of its monthly cycle.  Below the map proper extensive Latin text discusses Selenography.   This map first appeared in J. B. Homann’s 1707  Neuer Atlas  and was later reissued as plate no. 11 in Doppelmayr’s important 1742  Atlas Coelestis , which was also published by the Nuremburg firm of Johann Baptist Homann.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/World-bowen-1744,Antique Map: 1744 Bowen Map of the World in Hemispheres,A new & accurate map of all the known World drawn from the latest & most authentic surveys assisted by the best & most approved modern maps charts & c.,"An extremely attractive 1744 decorative double hemisphere world map by the English cartographer Emmanuel Bowen.  This beautiful map covers the entire world as it was understood in the middle part of the 18th century, before the explorations of Cook, Wilkes, and others.  Surrounded by decorative engravings of women representing each of the continents: America in the upper left, Europe in the upper right, Asia in the lower left, and Africa in the lower right.  The decorative baroque title cartouche appears at top center.  Color coding according to continent.  Limited inland detail, but major cities, geographical landmarks, and regions are noted.  In the tropics ocean currents are identified – a very unusual addition.  This map is most interesting for its treatment of the western coast of America, the Pacific, and most importantly, Australia.   Bowen issued this map during a dark period in Australian exploration, the seventy-some years between the navigations of William Dampier in 1699 and Tobias Furneaux in 1773. Consequently most of the cartographic information on this map dates to 17th century Dutch expeditions to Australia’s western coast, such as those of Abel Tasman and William Janszoon.  Consequently we see a very ephemeral speculative mapping of the continent with Van Diemens’s Land (Tasmania) and New Guinea attached to the mainland.  The unexplored eastern coast of the continent is mapped simply as a straight line running from New Guinea directly south to the tip of Tasmania.    New Zealand appears in a very embryonic form as a single landmass with no western shore.  This most likely conforms to Abel Tasman’s 1642 sighting of the western coast of South Island.   Another curious landmass appearing to the northeast of New Holland or Australia and to the west of New Zealand is labeled “H. Ghost Land’.  From its geographical situation it may represent New Caledonia though it was not officially discovered until Captain Cook landed there in 1774.    Just to the north of New Zealand yet another mysterious landmass appears, this one is called “Tierra de Espirio Sancto”, a speculative enlargement and mismapping of the New Hebrides Islands as discovered by the Spanish explorer and religious zealot Pedro Fernandez di Quir, or Quiros.  Quiros, believing he had discovered the great southern continent of Terre Australis, mapped the islands much larger then they in fact were.  Another smaller group of islands several hundred miles further east is also labeled after Quiros.  Secretive, self-delusional, fanatical, and inept, Quiros made charts that bordered on fictional.  It took several hundred years and no less a navigator than James Cook to finally figure out exactly what Quiros actually discovered.  Though Siberia exhibits considerable detail consistent with Vitus Bering’s 1728 exploration of the region, the opposite side of the Strait, in America, is less clear.  Bowen identifies it as the “Supposed Strait of Anian” and “Parts Undiscovered”, leaving much of the northwestern parts of America blank. What he does do, however, is leave a number of inlets in what is today California that are highly suggestive of possible northwest passages.  He also labeled “Drakes’ Port”, the site where Sir Francis Drank supposedly landed, restocked, and repaired his vessels during his 1579 circumnavigation of the globe.  Today the true location of Drake’s Port is a much debated cartographic mystery.  What we know from Drake is that it is a safe harbor that lies to the north of the furthest Spanish Claim, Point Loma, along the coast that Drake named New Albion.  Some have associated Drake’s Harbor with San Francisco Bay, Bodega Bay, or San Pablo Bay, but since the relevant records were lost in the 1698 burning of London’s Whitehall Palace, we may never know.  Also of interest is Bowen’s mapping of “De Gama’s Land” just to the south of Siberia.",1744 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/bowen.txt,"Bowen, E., <i>A complete system of geography.

This example is a reissue, apparently from the same plate, dating to the Hardy edition of the  Manual of the Corporation of New York , 1871.  Perhaps this map’s most striking feature is the fact that the orientation of the map and the orientation of the title are at odds.  We have stumbled across this piece a few times from both the first and second issues, and all examples exhibit the same conflicting orientation. Since this map was originally published to supplement a book of pictures and views of New York and vicinity by T.S. Fay, we can speculate that the limited budget of the publisher, Peabody and Company, made a reissue of the map impractical despite the orientation error.

Those who know New York’s shoreline will pause at the perfect blocks and ridged angles of this plan no more accurate today than it was in 1801 when Mangin first presented it.  Mangin, a talented French architect, and Goerck, an established New York Surveyor, were commissioned by the Common Council of New York to prepare a new regulatory map of the city.  Though Goerck passed away before the plan could be completed, Mangin finished the plan on a grand scale, re-envisioning New York City in his own image.  Mangin even added streets such as Mangin Street and Goerck Street which would have been submerged under the East River had they actually existed (as a side note another of Mangin’s Street’s, South Street, did eventually appear).  The Mangin-Goerck plan went far beyond the Common Council’s dreams of an administrative plan and, due to its inclusion of “intended improvements”, new streets, and idealized block structure, enjoyed a short lifespan.    It is curious then that in 1807 William Bridges, the talented City Surveyor who, in 1811, laid New York’s famous grid structure, resurrected and pirated the Mangin-Goerck Plan, attaching his own name to it.  It was a private venture that led Bridges to piracy.  He was commissioned by Dr. Samuel Mitchell to provide a map to illustrate Mitchell’s  Picture of New York , a travel guide intended for foreign tourist.  Perhaps Bridges chose the Mangin plan simply because, as a failed city plan, there were few obstacles to his use of it, but we do pity the hapless tourists who leapt into the east river in pursuit of Mangin Street.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Brooklyn-bishop-1868,"Antique Map: 1868 Bishop Pocket Map of Brooklyn, New York",Map of the Consolidated City of Brooklyn.,"An extremely rare first edition  of William Bishop's 1868 pocket map of the city of Brooklyn, New York.  In the mid-19th century, fueled by the advent of the steam ferry, which made crossing the East River practical, Kings County experienced an massive population burst.  Wealthy and poor alike were quick to abandon the dirty and claustrophobic Manhattan for then suburban lands just across the East River.  In 1855 the communities of Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Bushwick and Williamsburg were consolidated by the State of New York into one large city, modern day Brooklyn.  It was around this time that the term “Kings County” began to fall out of popular usage in favor of “Brooklyn”.    By 1865, three years before this map was printed, Brooklyn had become the third largest city in America, following New York and Philadelphia.  Here Brooklyn is revealed in the midst of this incredible development.  Prospect Park, which was still being built, is shown, as is Greenwood cemetery.  The street layout, mimicking the grid system of Manhattan, is shown in considerable detail.  Attempts to detail important buildings, ferry crossings, bridges, train lines, and “plank roads.”  Also notes public buildings and lands such as the Lunatic Asylum, the Hospital, the Alms House, the Military Parade Grounds, the Marine Hospital and the Navy Yard.  Manhattan appears in the lower left hand corner of the map.  North is oriented to the lower left. The whole is surrounding by a decorative vine and leave border.  This map was drawn by A. Brown of 47 Nassau Street, New York, for inclusion in Henry McCloskey’s 1863 Manual of the City and Corporation of Brooklyn.  Cartographically this map references and expands upon the 1846 map of Brooklyn surveyed and prepared by Richard Butt.  Of note is the fact that this map, issued just months after Prospect Park's October 1867 completion,  is one of the first maps to show Olmstead's design. The only other copy of this map we have been able to identify is the McCloskey edition in the collection of the Brooklyn Public Library.  Ours is in superior condition.  An extremely rare map.

This extraordinary map reveals Prospect Park as conceived by the landscape architects, and indeed “Artists”, Vaux and Olmstead. Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Prospect Park in 1866 by the Brooklyn Common Council. Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park. The creation of Prospect Park, which was to consist of some 585 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design. The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned. Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Though Olmstead is best known for his work in New York's Central Park, there are many who consider Prospect Park, his second masterpiece, to be his finest.

This may well be the first published plan of Eastern Parkway, which began construction about 2 years after this initial layout was published.  According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, The world's first parkway was conceived by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1866. The term parkway was coined by these designers as a landscaped road built expressly for 'pleasure-riding and driving' or scenic access to Prospect Park (also designed by Olmsted and Vaux). To these ends, commerce was restricted. The parkway was constructed from Grand Army Plaza to Ralph Avenue (the boundary of the City of Brooklyn) between 1870 and 1874. Olmsted and Vaux intended Eastern Parkway to be the Brooklyn nucleus of an interconnected park and parkway system for the New York area. The plan was never completed but their idea of bringing the countryside into the city influenced the construction of major parks and parkways in cities throughout the United States.

Roy de La Grand Bretagne Par le R. P. Louis de Hennepin Mission: Recol: et Not: Apost: Chez c. Specht a Utreght 1698.,"A map that fundamentally impacted the cartographic history of America, this is the 1698 Friar Hennepin map of North America.  Covering all of North America from the Equator to the Arctic, this map is remarkable on a number of levels including its depiction of California as an Island, the addition of Terre de Iesso in the extreme northwest, the presence of Lake Apalache in the southeast, the inclusion of Lake Parima and El Dorado in South America, and the suggestion of a Northwest Passage.  However, it is best known for its remarkable and highly influential rendering of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley.   In 1679 the French lord René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle set out from Fort Frontenac, on Lake Ontario, to explore the Great Lakes and eventually make his way into the Mississippi River.  La Salle was of the belief that the Mississippi connected to other water routes that would eventually lead to the Pacific.  His scribe and chronicler on this expedition was a Dutch Friar of the Franciscan Recollect order, Antoine Louis Hennepin.  Hennepin, who had a passion for “pure and severe virtue” and La Salle, who had a passion for “moral weaknesses” never quite saw eye to eye.  Nonetheless, the expedition sailed (and were the first to do so) through Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron into Lake Michigan, then followed the St. Joseph River to what is today South Bend Indiana, where they constructed Fort Crevecoeur, present day Peoria, Illinois.  At this point the explorers parted ways with La Salle returning on foot to Frontenac to resupply and Hennepin continuing onward via the Illinois River to the Mississippi.   Hennepin attempted to explore southwards towards the mouth of the Mississippi but, in his own words, “the nations did not give us the time to navigate up and down this river.”  Instead he traveled northward past St. Anthony Falls and modern day Minneapolis to Lac des Issatis (Leech Lake), a source of the Mississippi.  From here Hennepin attempted a return to Fort Crevecoeur, but was instead captured by a band of wandering Sioux who took him to the Mille Lacs region of Minnesota, near Lake Superior.  Hennepin remained in Sioux custody until the adventurer Daneil Greysolon Delhut, who had negotiated a peace treaty with the Sioux, ransomed him.     Hennepin and La Salle never met again.  La Salle went on to explore the length of the Mississippi, named Louisiana, claimed it for France, and established a short lived colony near Matagorda Bay, Texas.   Hennepin, who had enough adventure, returned to France where he published an enormously popular book,  Description de la Louisiane .  This book featured a map that depicted a speculative course of the Mississippi, but did not suggest any exploration of the southward path of the River beyond it conjunction with the Illinois.    Ten years later La Salle was been assassinated in modern day Texas by Pierre Duhaut.  Meanwhile, Hennepin, perhaps seeing an opportunity for self-aggrandizement, fled to England (it is William III of England who’s arms appear in the title cartouche of this map) where he published another book,  Nouvelle Decouverte d’un tres grand Pays Situe dans L’Amerique  and another map – this one.    In his second major work Hennepin suggested that, for fear of La Salle, he had hidden the full extent of his explorations:   This is where I would like all the world to know the mystery of this discovery that I have hidden until now so as not to inflict sorrow on Sieur de La Salle, who wanted all the glory and secret knowledge of this discovery for himself alone. This is why he sacrificed several persons to prevent them from publishing what they had seen and from foiling his secret plans.  In his second enormously popular work; Hennepin claimed that he had explored the full length of the Mississippi before La Salle.",1698 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/hennepin.txt,"Hennepin, Louis, <i>Nouvelle Decouverte d'un tres grand Pays, situe dans L'Amerique, entre le Nouveau Mexique et la Mer Glaciale, </i>, (Utrecht), 1698 (Second edition).

Sheet No. 2 From the Mouth of the Magothy River to the Mouth of the Hudson River. - Preliminary Chart of Chesapeake Bay Sheet No. 3 From the Mouth of the Hudson River to the Mouth of the Potomac River.,"This is a monumental and rarely available three part 1857 nautical chart or maritime map of the Chesapeake Bay.  Prepared for the 1857 edition of the U.S. Coast Survey’s  Superintendent’s Report  this giant map covers from the top of the Chesapeake Bay and the mouth of the Susquehanna River to the mouth of the Potomac River.  The top or first chart covers from the head of the Bay to the Mouth of the Magothy River, inclusive of the Patapsco River and the city of Baltimore – which is detailed to the street level.  The second or middle chart covers from the Magothy River to the mouth of the Hudson River and includes Annapolis, Cambridge, and Easton.  This second chart also bears the title of the three map series in addition to its individual title. The bottom or third chart in this series covers from the mouth of the Hudson River to the mouth of the Potomac River.  The United States Coast Survey considered the construction of a detailed map of the Chesapeake Bay to be one of its top priorities. Various commands under Blunt, Maffit, Cutts, Hassler, Lee, Nelson, Gerdes, and others contributed extensive data to the multi-year effort.  Careful observers will note that the upper sheets seem darker than the lower sheets.  In the effort to map this region, the northern extremes of the Chesapeake Bay, long considered the most dangerous and poorly charted, where given precedence.  Thus does a density of data, including countless depth soundings, topographical data, and sailing instructions,  give evidence to the stately progress of the survey in the Chesapeake Bay.  Each sheet from this series measures some 30 x 37 inches for an overall dimension of roughly 93 x 38 inches.   Though these maps do occasionally appear individually they are rarely available as a set and are exceptionally uncommon in such excellent condition.   Published under the supervision of A. D.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/GreatLakes-bellin-1755,Antique Map: 1755 Bellin Map of the Great Lakes,Partie Occidentale de la Nouvelle France ou du Canada.,"A rare and extremely influential 1755 map of the Great Lakes drawn by Jacques Nicholas Bellin.  This map, which appeared in the 1755 issue of the Homann Heirs  Atlas Major , covers all five of the Great Lakes as well as the adjacent Indian lands and the English colonies of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.   Cartographically this map offers a number of important innovations and is largely derived from Bellin’s very similar map of 1745.  The plate was acquired and reissued by Homann Heirs in 1755 in response to European interest in the French and Indian War which started one year prior in 1754.    Bellin based this map on the most advanced French cartographic intelligence available at the time.  Heidenrich and Dahl consider this map to constitute “the first new material pertaining to New France to appear since the maps of Guillaume de L'Isle three decades earlier.  Most notably this map incorporates the work of the French fur trader and explorer Sieur la Verendrye and the explorer-missionary Father Pierre de Charlevoix.     From Verendrye , Bellin is able to extract a significantly advanced view, over De L’Isle, of the form of the Great Lakes and their client river systems.  He also relies on Verendrye’s journals with regard to the placement of numerous Indian nations and villages.  Charlevoix is generally regarded as Bellin’s source for his curious choice to include several fictional islands in Lake Superior, including I. Philippeaux, I. Pontchartrain, and I. St. Anne.   This map is the first, though hardly the last, to depict these ghost islands which baffled explorers until the early 19th century.    A quick overview of this map will reveal a territory that is very much dominated by various American Indian nations though nominally under a tenuous French hegemony.  The vast lands of the Miami, the Iroquois, the Erie, the Huron, the Renard, the Mascouten, and the Illinois overwhelm tiny bastions of French power in the form of various forts and missions.   Among these are Fort Frontenac, Fort Niagara, Mission Francois Xavier, and the fledgling “R. et Port de Checagou,” the future site of Chicago.   The French, without the vast colonial resources of the English and Spanish, relied heavily on alliance with, rather than outright control of, indigenous populations.  Thus it is understandable why the American Indian nations of this region were quick to throw their lot in with the French against the domineering English during the French and Indian War.   In the lower right hand quadrants of this map Bellin employs a common cartographic trick to flatter his royal patrons in Paris.  By diminishing the proportional size of the English colonial holdings in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and New York, Bellin, at least metaphorically, advances the supremacy of the French dominions in North America.   In addition to its advanced mapping of the Great Lakes, its introduction of the ghost islands of Lake Superior, and its incorporation of the most recent explorations in the region, this map enjoys lasting significance due to  John Mitchell’s use of it in compiling his important wall map,  A Map of the British &amp; French Dominions in North America .  Mitchell’s monumental cartographic masterpiece was used in 1783 to define the boundaries between Canada and the post-Revolutionary United States, forming the basis for national borders that are still in effect today.",1755 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/bellin.txt,"<i>Atlas Homannianus Mathematic-Historice Delineatus</i>, (Homann Heirs, Nuremburg), 1755.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/GreatLakes-bellin-1755.jpg,GreatLakes-bellin-1755,21.5,17.5

This is an extremely rare pocket map variant on the map of Central Park that later appeared in the 1860  Commissioner's Annual Report on the Progress of Central Park .  This map is not listed in Haskell and to our knowledge was not issued to the public in pocket format – only in the  Commissioner's Annual Report .  Most likely it was available only to those city officials actually involved in the planning and construction of Central Park.  In this case, said official was the important New York Lawyer A. H. Green.  This extraordinary map reveals Central Park as conceived by the Landscape Architects, and indeed “artists”, Vaux and Olmstead. Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council. Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park. The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design. The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned. Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Historian Gloria Deak writes, There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’ Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privilege of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban public recreation area in the world.  This map also features a manuscript annotation showing the progress of Baron Renfrew through Central Park on October 12, 1860.  Baron Renfrew is one of the titles associated with the Prince of Wales and was commonly used when the Price wanted to make an “unofficial” trip – as with his 1860 visit to New York.  In this case, Baron Renfew is Prince Albert Edward who was 19 at the time.  The Prince Albert Edward acceded in 1901 as Edward VII.  Though most maps are without substantial provenance, this map is known to have been originally owned  by the prominent 19th century New Yorker Andrew Haswell Green (1820 - November 13, 1903).  A. H. Green was a New York lawyer, city planner, civic leader and agitator for reform.

Depicts the continent of Africa form an early 18th century perspective.  The Niger River is mapped with surprising accuracy, especially considering its highly inaccurate mappings nearly 100 years later in the 19th century.   The Mountains of the Moon, supposed source of the Nile, are located considerably south of where they appear in other maps of the period.   Early Ptolemaic maps do note these mountains as well as two large lakes just to the north.  Though the Mountains are present, both of these lakes are absent indicating an interesting evolution, away from the Ptolemaic conception, in African cartography.  In southern Africa to large empires are named, Monoemugi and Monomotapa.    This is the great southern African gold mining region and these names are likely taken from the names of prominent Congolese tribal rulers.  Surrounding the map are the curious addition of twelve armorial crests.  Crests include those of both Arab and African powers in the region including: Barbarie, Maroc (Morocco), Egypt, Tripoli, Notolie, Malta, Congo, Nubia, Monomotape, and Nigreitie.  Many  of these kingdoms and their associated armorial crests are purely conjectural.  Ethiopia for example is indicated as distinct from Abyssinia with two separate crests, both unrelated to any actual crests that the kingdom seems to have used.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/AztecMigration-gemelli-1704,Antique Map: 1704 Gemelli Map of the Aztec Migration from Aztlan to Chapultapec,"The copy of a antient picture kept by D. Carlos Siguenza in which is drawn & describ'd the road the antient Mexicans travell'd when they came fromteh Mountains to inhabe the Lake, call'd at present of Mexico, with the Hieroglyphicks signifying the names of places & other things.","This unusual 1704 map, drawn by Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri, is the first published representation of the legendary Aztec migration from Aztlan, a mysterious paradise somewhere to the northwest of Mexico, to Chapultepec Hill, currently Mexico City.   This map, supposedly a rendering copied from indigenous sources traces the pilgrimage conceptually and, though hard to follow as a map, embraces both cartographic and spiritual elements.   The various stations on the map are labeled in both Nahuatl and loose English translation.  Aztlan appears here in the upper right corner as a lake in which sits a mountain and a palm tree.  The progression meanders along many paths and digressions to finally arrive upper right quadrant where we see a hill upon which rests a gigantic Grasshopper - Chapultepec.     According to legend on exactly May 24, 1065 CE, the Mexica (Aztec) began an epic migration from their ancestral homeland, Aztlan, which translated means “Place of Reeds” or “Place of Egrets”, to the shores of Lake Texcoco, in Mexico’s Central Mesa.  There they founded the city of Tenochtitlan which in time spawned the vast Aztec Empire famously encountered by Hernan Cortez several hundred years later.  The migration, which seems to have lasted some 250 years, is comparable in scope to the biblical wanderings of the Israelites recorded in Exodus. The legends associated with the Aztec wanderings gave birth to this conceptual map of places and events.  Though most of the early stopping points on this map are difficult to correspond with factual localities, the later part of the migration seems to be rooted in the historical with sites like Chapultepec and Lake Texcoco clearly identifiable.  Nonetheless, an attempt to reconcile the early points on the pilgrimage was made by no less than the renowned naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.  Humboldt was a great believer in indigenous cartographic knowledge and incorporated it into his many important maps – often with significant success.   Humboldt no doubt had this very map before him (he references Gemelli) when he drew is seminal 1811 map of New Spain on which many of the stops on the Aztec migration, illustrated here, are noted.  Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri was a Neapolitan lawyer and adventurer who spent several years traveling the world in the 1690s. In Mexico, Gemelli was inspired by pre-Columbian culture and dedicated several chapters of his important book  Giro Intorno al Mondo  to discussing Aztec history and legends.  This map, along with Gemelli’s equally important representation of the Aztec Calendar, first appeared in the 1704 English edition of his work – presumably Gemelli chose not publish all of his maps and drawing in the earlier Italian edition.   Though Gemelli’s work attained great fame in Europe, by the end of the 18th century it was considered to be mostly fictional.  It was Alexander von Humboldt who, in 1811, resuscitated Gemelli’s reputation.  In preparing his important map of New Spain Humboldt found himself impressed with Gemelli’s in depth geographical knowledge of Mexico, which he understood could only have been obtained through actual experience. This map was published in the English edition of Gemelli’s  A Voyage Round the World .  Neither this map nor Gemelli’s important reproduction of the Aztec calendar appeared in the earlier Italian edition of his work.",1704 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/gemelli.txt,"Gemelli Careri, G.

This map shows cities, topographical features, railways, ferries and roads with color coding at the county level.  Additionally shows important mountain passes, the route of famous explores including Fremont (1843), and the ill-conceived Stevens route for the Pacific Railroad.   The origins of this map can be traced to Johnson’s acquisition of J. H. Colton’s c. 1855 map plates.  Due to the rapidly changing political situation in the Pacific Northwest during the middle part of the 19th century, Johnson was forced to update his map of this region on an annual and sometimes semi-annual basis, thus making all editions extremely ephemeral.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/World-vaugondy-1784,Antique Map: 1784 Vaugondy Map of the World on Mercator Projection,Mappe Monde suivant la projection des cartes reduites.,"This uncommon 1784 map of the world on a Mercator projection by Robert de Vaugondy occupies the ephemeral period between Captain Cook’s second and third voyages.    Cooks explorations along the eastern coast of Australia as well as around New Caledonia and are in evidence while his later work in the Pacific, including his important exploration of American northwestern coastline, is noticeably absent.  Instead the northwest coast of America is loosely ghosted in with minor inland notations regarding the fictional discoveries of Admiral de Fonte.  Barthlomew de Fonte was supposedly a Spanish Admiral who, sailing up the Pacific coast c. 1640 discovered a series of gigantic lakes, seas, and rivers heading eastward towards the Hudson Bay. Upon one of these great inland lakes he met with a ship from Boston that claimed to have come through a Northwestern Passage. De Fonte’s story appeared in a short lived 1706 English publication entitled “Memoirs of the Curious”. The story inspired no less than Joseph-Nicholas de L’Isle, younger brother of the better known Guilleme de L’Isle.  Joseph-Nicholas was at the time employed by the Russian Tzar Peter the Great in the compilation of Russian surveys and discoveries in Siberia and the extreme northeast of Asia. When he published his somewhat accurate map of northeast Asia, he paradoxically decided to include on the same page an entirely speculative map of North America based largely on De Fonte’s letter.  De L’Isle’s mantle was later taken up by Jefferys, another ardent supporter of the Northwest Passage theory, who incuded De Fonte’s discoveries in his own map of the region, which was, ultimately, the inspiration for this map by Vaugondy.   Elsewhere on this map Tasmania or Van Dimenians land is erroneously attached to the Australian mainland.  Similarly, between Korea and Kamtschatka, Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, is attached to Sakhalin – a common error of the period.    This map typically appears in one of three color schemes designed to illustrated either world religious, skin tone, or race.  This particular example is colorized to emphasize the predominance of various skin tones in different parts of the world. Whites (les Blancos) are represented by green, brown skin (les Bruns) are identified by red, yellow skin (les Juanatres) by yellow, and olive skin (les Olivatres) by light green.

Though variants of this map appear as early as 1708, this is the most important of the series due to its thematic focus on the New England, New York, New Jersey Pennsylvania postal system.    Official postal service emerged in the New England colonies around 1639 when the Massachusetts General Court designated a Boston tavern as the official repository for mail arriving from or departing overseas. In 1673 official postal service between New York and Boston was introduced on a monthly basis but it was not until 1691, with the appointment of a Postmaster General to the colonies, that a centralized postal system evolved.  The first post route in the Colonies, between New York and Boston, became known as the Boston Post Road and is today still in use as U.S. Route 1.  Moll describes this route in some detail in the lower right quadrant of the map:    The Western Post setts out from Philadelphia every Fryday leaving Letters at Burlington and Pert Amboy  and arrives at New York on Sunday night; the distance between Philadelphia and New York being 106 Miles.  The Post goes out Eastward every Monday morning from New York, and arrives at Seabrook Thursday noon; being 150 Miles, where the Post from Boston setts out at the same time; the New York Post returning with the Eastern Letters, and the Boston Post with the Western, Bags are dropt at New London, Stommington, Rhode Island, and Bristol.  The Post from Boston to Piscataway being 70 Miles leaves Letters at Ipswich, Salem, Marblehead, and New : berry.  There are office keept at Burlington, Perth Amboy in New Jersey, New London and Stommington in Connecticott, at Rhode Island, Bristol, Ipswich, Salem, Marblehead, and Newberry, and the 3 Great Offices are at Boston, New York &amp; Philadelphia.  In addition to this maps core details regarding the postal system in America, it also offers additional information on the region including American Indian villages and nations on the west side of the Susquehanna, countless towns and villages, some offshore shoals, and a gross mismapping of Lake Champlain.  New Jersey is split into East New Jersey and West New Jersey – an archaic distinction dating to a 28 year period between 1674 and 1702.  Delaware is conjoined with Pennsylvania.  Though Barbara McCorkle reports that this map was published in a number of different atlases and histories, this is an early example from the 1729 first edition of Moll’s  Atlas Minor .",1729 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/moll.txt,"Moll, H., <i>Atlas minor: or a new and curious set of sixty-two maps, in which are shewn all the empires, kingdoms, countries, states, in all the known parts of the earth; with their bounds, divisions, chief cities & towns, the whole composed & laid down agreable to modern history.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/CarolinabyMoll-moll-1746,Antique Map: 1746 Herman Moll Map of Carolina,Carolina by H. Moll Geographer.,"A small but significant 1729 map of Carolina by Herman Moll.   This map covers from the mouth of the Chesapeake to St. Augustine and from the Atlantic westward to the mouth of the Apalache River, encompassing the entire territory defined by the Carolina Grant of 1663 as well as additional territory in modern day Georgia and Florida added in a later revised grant.  Moll notes the principal roadways along the coast as well as many important trade routes leading westward into American Indian lands.  Along the coastline several islands are identified for the first time in a printed map.  Also noted are various battles including the 1705 destruction of the mission of St. Maria de Palaxy along the Gulf Coast, Colonel Barnwell’s 1712 defeat of the Tuscarora (the first major military victory by Carolina settlers over an Indian nation), and Colonel Craven’s 1716 route of the Yamasee.   More importantly (and interestingly) this is also one of the few maps to depict the fanciful utopian colony of Azilia in modern day Georgia.  In 1717, sixteen years before Georgia was founded, Sir Robert Montgomery proposed the creation of the Margravate of Azilia.  The plan, laid out on a bold scale, would generate a buffer zone between the Carolina Colony and French, Spanish, and Indian incursions from the west.  The colony never materialized largely due to lack of interest, but Moll’s inclusion of it here marks this as one of the earlier examples of this map.  In the later editions Azilia is replaced by “Georgia”.  This map was issued in a number of different states from 1729 to about 1750.  This particular example was issued in volume three of Samuel Simpson’s  The Agreeable Historian  published in London in the 1740s.",1746 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/moll.txt,"Simpson, S., <i>The Agreeable Historian</i>, (London) 1746.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CarolinabyMoll-moll-1746.jpg,CarolinabyMoll-moll-1746,11,8

Also ye Trade Winds, and ye Several Tracts made by ye Taleons and Flota from Place to Place.","This is Herman Molls small but significant c. 1732 map of the West Indies.  Moll’s map covers all of the West Indies, eastern Mexico, all of Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, North America as far as the Chesapeake Bay, and the northern portion of South America, commonly called the Spanish Main.  Typical of Moll’s style this map offers a wealth of information including ocean currents and some very interesting commentary.    Additionally Moll, most likely through his acquaintance with pirates William Dampier and Woodes Rogers, offers a wealth of information on the traffic of silver bearing Spanish treasure fleets  en route  from the Mexican port of Veracruz, through the islands, to Spanish ports in Europe.   Following the dotted line, Moll identifies the Spanish treasure fleet's  entrada  into the Caribbean via the passage between Granada and Trinidad. The fleet then sailed westwards, skirting the Spanish Main until they reached Cartagena, where they rested and reprovisioned before heading northwards, rounding western Cuba and stopping in Havana. Using the strong Gulf Stream current - shown here - ships would sail northwards from Havana while being steadily forced to the southeast thus alighting at the deep water port of Veracruz. On the return, laden with silver from the mines of San Luis Potosi, the Spanish fleet took advantage of eastward blowing trade winds, which helped to overcome the strong current on the sail to Havana. From Havana they would travel northwards via the narrow passage between Florida and the Bahamas before cutting eastward and out to sea at St. Augustine. It was here, in this crucial passage between the English dominated Bahamas and Spanish Florida, where the most nefarious pirates and British Privateers lay in wait for their profitable prey.   Moll further fills this marvelous map with numerous notations that, while bearing no direct impact on piracy in the region, do offer considerable insight into his political persuasions. He identifies, for example the river route through Tabasco and Chiapas, via which supplies and cannons were transported to the important Pacific port of Acapulco.  Moll also makes some interesting choices with regard to his mapping of the French territories in North America, namely New France and Louisiana.  He firstly, in a nod to La Salle’s colony of St. Louis, extends French control of Louisiana westward to the present day Texas-Mexico border of the Rio del Norte or, as it is known today the Rio Grande.   He also includes Florida in the French regions – a very curious anti-Spanish stance.   The North American British colonies including Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and Maryland are also noted.  This map was issued in a number of different states from 1729 to about 1750. Most commoly it appeared as plate no. 55 in Herman Moll and Thomas Bowles'  Atlas Minor .

Bethesda Terrace is located at roughly 72nd street in the heart of New York City’s Central Park.  Depicts the Terrace from a south facing perspective over “the Lake” towards the Bethesda Fountain and the sculpture, “Angel of the Waters”.   The arched double staircase behind the fountain was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould.  It is important to realize that this part of the park was merely planned, not completed, when this view was made.  The central sculpture, “Angel of the Waters” by Emma Stebbins, was not completed until 1873.  Vaux and Olmstead envisioned the terrace as a meeting place in the heart of the park.  Today it is one of the most picturesque parts of the park and a popular hangout for artists and musicians. This view was published for inclusion in the 1869 13th Annual Report of the Commissioners of Central Park .  On  the Central Park:  Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council.  Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park.  The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design.  The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned.  Olmstead wrote:   “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”   Historian Gloria Deak writes,  “There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’”  Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privlidge of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban  public recreation area in the world.",1869,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/sarony.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Terrace-centralpark-1868.jpg,Terrace-centralpark-1868,14.5,8

Cz: en 1718, 1720, et 1721.","An uncommon variant on Carl Van Verden’s important 1719 – 1721 mapping of the Caspian Sea.  Around 1718 the Russian Tzar, Peter the Great, sponsored a number of cartographic expeditions to the farthest reaches of his vast empire.  Most of these were headed up by Dutch navigators, the most experienced and mercenary of the era.  Carl Van Verden, a Dutch seaman, was commissioned as a Russian naval officer and assigned the task of mapping the Caspian Sea.  Though well known since antiquity the world’s largest lake was largely ignored by surveyors until Van Verden’s work in the early 18th century.  Van Verden’s work had significant political ramifications.  Peter the Great, Russia’s most expansionist Tzar, was determined to make the Caspian a “Russian Lake” and invaded the region in 1722 seizing Derbent and Baku.  Copies of Van Verden’s work eventually made their way to Paris via Nicholas de L’Isle, brother to the more famous cartographer G. de L’Isle.   Geographers in Paris quick recognized the importance of the work and the era most significant cartographers and map publishers, including Homann, De L’Isle, Moll, and Covens and Mortier, were quick to copy and publish their own variants of the Van Verden chart.   This example is of the more obscure such charts.  Published in Paris around 1730, this map offers a number of important elements.  All text is in both French and transliterated Russian, so “Bulsebek” becomes “Usbech” and “La Mer Caspie” becomes “More Gualenskoi”, etc.  Many of the mountains along the lake’s western and southern shores are noted and curiously rendered with an unusual lake-centric orientation.  Also noted are the Caspian’s various reefs, shoals, sandbars, and other undersea dangers.",c. 1730 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/vanverden.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CaspienSea-vanverden-1721.jpg,CaspienSea-vanverden-1721,12,16

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Devon-donn-1765,"Antique Map: 1765 Benjamin Donn Wall Map of Devonshire and Exeter, England","A Map of the County of Devon, with the City & County of Exeter.","This is a very rare and highly important 1765 wall map of Devonshire by Benjamin Donn.  Drawn in twelve panels, this map covers the entirety of Devonshire or Devon from the English Channel to Barnstaple (Bideford) Bay and from Cornwall to Somerset at a scale of 1 inch to 1 mile.  Donn also incorporates large insets of Exeter (showing the college), Plymouth, Plymouth Dock, Stoke Town, and the Isle of Lundy.  An elaborate decorative title cartouche with various allegorical elements appears in the lower left quadrant.  In 1759 the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufacturers, and Commerce (since 1847 known as the Royal Society for the Arts), following the suggestion of the Cornish antiquarian William Borlase, offered a £100 award for a large scale one  inch to the mile map of any English county.  Benjamin Donn, the first to step up to the Borlase’s challenge, began work on his map of Devon in 1760.  Five years later Donn’s extraordinary project reached completion.  The Society was awed by the magnitude and detail of Donn’s “accurate, actual survey” and promptly awarded him the £100.  Though the actual work of completing the survey and print the map cost Donn, by his own estimation, nearly £2000, the prestige of issuing the first large scale British county map earned him both robust subsequent sales and the admiration of his peers.  Donn’s vast map of Devon and Exeter offers a wealth of detail and stands up to extensive study.   As the first significant large scale British county map, this remarkable chart introduces a number of cartographic conventions that would become standardized in subsequent county and regional maps.  These include Donn’s techniques for rendering turnpike roads versus fenced roads versus open roads as well as his innovative iconography relating the identification of farms, cottages, churches, villages, and estates.   In addition to the inclusion of typical cartographic features, it also includes such oddities as country inns, pleasure houses, lime kilns, the birthplace of Sr. Walter Raleigh, potato markets, ancient roman ruins, druidic ruins, subterranean passages, mileage, elevation and some 656 gentleman’s seats.   This map was drawn and surveyed by Benjamin Donn and printed by Thomas Jeffreys in twelve separate but joinable panels.  Donn dedicated his map to John Baring of Mount-Radford and Matthew Lee of Ebford, local notables who may have helped Donn finance his survey work.  This is a highly decorative and unusual example of this particular map.  Most examples of this map appear bound in book format with large centerfolds and outline or no color.  This unusual example must have been prepared at a special request and is the only full original color example we have seen.  It is recorded that Donn charged 2 extra shillings for binding and 5 extra for coloring, and an additional unknown premium for exceptionally fine full coloring.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Planisphere-levasseur-1853,Antique Map: 1852 Levasseur Map of the World,Planisphere.,"A visually stunning decorative map of the world dating to 1852, by French map publisher Victor Levasseur.    Levasseur depicts the world on a Mercator Projection, showing the six known continents as well as traces of Antarctica.    The cartographic style of this piece is minimalist, but a few elements do bear special note.  These include the extension of Oregon territory well into British Columbia, reflecting the American claims that later led to the 54’ 40” dispute.  Also in North America, Texas is identified as an independent nation.  Far to the north both the Northwest Passage over America and the Northeast Passage over Europe and Asia, are drawn as open and practically navigable waterways.   By far this map's most striking feature is its elaborate allegorical border work.  Levasseur composed this map for publication in his magnificent  Atlas Nacionale de la France Illustree , one of the most decorative and beautifully produced atlases to appear in the 19th century.   This particular map is surrounded by four medallions bearing allegorical representations of the seasons.  Spring, in the upper left, is represented by a young unclothed woman modestly covering herself with garlands.  Summer, in the lower right, is a powerful bearded man wearing an animal skin and surrounded by the bounty of life. Fall, upper right, is a young man reaping the harvest.  And winter, lower left, is a huddled old woman in a barren snow covered setting.    Atop the map is an image of the firmament, with shooting starts, clouds, and a symbolic representation of the Zodiac.  At center is a curious unclothed women with four breasts who appears to be chained to the earth or to a heavy box which she is holding - Pandora?  Adam and Eve appear to her right walking hand in hand through pre-fall Eden.  There too is the serpent, slithering just behind the couple.    At the base of the map an even more interesting scene unfolds in the form of a curious panorama.  Here Jesus sits enthroned, bearing a cross in his left hand and pointing with his right, his head surrounded by a pyramid (a Masonic reference?).  To his left are a stoic crowd including Napoleon, Socrates, and other unidentifiable great men bearing signs reading Paix (peace), Liber (freedom), and Egalite (equality).  Behind them is a domed building that appears to be a Greek or Roman temple.  Opposite this scene, on Jesus' right is a very different scene showing a crowd fleeing in terror - these include a Pharisee holding the Torah and a turbaned Saracen. Behind them are the pyramids of Egypt.  They are running towards what appears to be the jungle in the midst of which is a plinth upon which sets a bust of Satan.  In this we can only assume that Levasseur is attempting to convey the righteousness of reason and logic over emotion and old world superstition. Published by V.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/America-visscher-1658,Antique Map: 1658 Visscher Map of North America and South America,Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio.,"A striking first edition example of an extremely important and influential 1658 map of the Americas by Nicholas Janzoon Visscher.   Covers all of the New World, the eastern extensions of Europe and Africa, and some Pacific Islands.  This map proved extremely influential and, due to multiple pirated examples and reissues by competing Dutch map publishers, became the dominant representation of America well into the early 18th century.  That said, the first edition is notably different from its successors on a number of points that firmly establish its preeminence as a cartographic milestone.   By far this map’s most interesting cartographic elements deal with its unusual treatment of North America, with California represented as an island, the Great Lakes rendered as a single body of water open to the west, and Anian appearing far to the north.    The popularity of this map among prominent Dutch map publishers and cartographers of the late 17th century played a significant role in promoting the “California as an Island” hypothesis. The concept of an insular California first appeared as a work of fiction in Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo's c. 1510 romance  Las Sergas de Esplandian , where he writes   Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons.  Baja California was subsequently discovered in 1533 by Fortun Ximenez, who had been sent to the area by Hernan Cortez. When Cortez himself traveled to Baja, he must have had Montalvo's novel in mind, for he immediately claimed the Island of California for the Spanish King. By the late 16th and early 17th century ample evidence had been amassed, through explorations of the region by Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcon, and others, that California was in fact a peninsula. However, by this time other factors were in play. Francis Drake had sailed north and claimed New Albion near modern day Washington or Vancouver for England. The Spanish thus needed to promote Cortez's claim on the Island of California to preempt English claims on the western coast of North America. The significant influence of the Spanish crown on European cartographers caused a major resurgence of the Insular California theory. About half a century after this map was drawn Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, published his own 1705 account of travels overland from Mexico to California, establishing conclusively the peninsularity of California.   Visscher’s rendering of the Great Lakes as a single body of water open to the west is of particular interest and is the most ephemeral element of this map, being updated in subsequent editions to reflect ongoing European exploration of the region.  At first glance Visscher’s great inland sea appears uncannily like Verazanno’s Sea, a 16th century speculative body of water extending to the Pacific through the center of North America, which was no doubt a direct influence on the water form established here.   Visscher describes his inland sea with the following Latin note:   Lacus iste quantum ex accolis colligi potuiy trecenta ut minimum miliaria en longitudinem pateat  This lake, as far as can be learned from the inhabitants, stretches at least three hundred miles in length  This is curiously identical to the text used by Jodocus Hondius on his world map of 1611 to describe his rendering of Verazanno’s Sea.  The next edition of this map would see this great inland sea replaced by more contemporary rendering of the Great Lakes taken from the explorations of La Salle, Hennepin, and others.   North of insular California we find the land of Anian, separated from the North American mainland by a narrow strait.",1658 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/visscher.txt,"Visscher, N., <i>Atlas Contractus Orbis Terrarum</i>,(Amsterdam) c. 1659.

Covers from the Crimea and the Sea of Azov south to the Persian Gulf and the Straight of Ormuz and east as far as Kashmir (Cachmir) and Kabul (Caboul).  This map includes modern day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, with adjacent parts of Russia, Pakistan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and Arabia.  Cartographically De L’Isle’s mapping of Persia marks a significant advance in European cartographic knowledge of the region.    This map benefits considerably from Russian cartographic surveys and other sources no doubt smuggled to Guillaume De L’Isle by his brother Nicholas de L’Isle, who held a cartographic position with the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The extent to which Russian data influenced this map is nowhere more evident than in De L’Isle’s remarkable rendering of the Caspian Sea – one of the first accurate maps of the great lake to follow Van Verden’s historic survey of 1721.  Russian cartographic information is also apparent with regard to place names, such as the Russian name for the Aral Sea (Glouchoiye).   It is equally likely that De L’Isle drew on Russian sources for his mapping of the Silk Route centers of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Ferghana, which were known stopping points for Russian trade envoys to China.   For the remainder of Persia De L’Isle most likely updated Persian and Arabic cartographic information with reports from Georgian and Armenian traders and mercenaries active throughout Persia.  It may be through these sources that De L’Isle was able to add considerable geographic information regarding trade routes and place names in central Persia.  These include such significant advances as the identification of Terheran (Tiheran), the current capital of Iran, which is notable absent it earlier European maps of Persia.

The European influence of this map can be seen in the French (around San Antonio) and German (near Austin) colonies noted in Texas.  Castroville appears as the major town in the Col.

As a whole this map is a significant advancement over earlier mappings of this region as evidenced in the works of De L’Isle and others.    Presented here are actually six maps on a single sheet.  The central map (Fig. 1), showing the entire course of the Ganges and the Ghaghara rivers, is a European style map produced by Tiefenthaler based upon his own travels and quadrant surveys as well as on the indigenous cartography he collected along the way.  Four of the five smaller maps presented are in fact Tiefenthaler’s copies of Indian maps given to or provided for him.  The stylistic difference between these and the central European style map are clear, especially as regarding the rendering of direction, bodies of water, and topography.      Tiefenthaler’s copies of indian cartographic material include figures II, III, IV, and V.  Figure II correctly locates the source of the Ganges at the Gangotri Glacier, Gaumukah, known as the “Cow’s Mouth” due to its strong resemblance to the open mouth of a cow.  Figure III, a large map at the top center, focuses on the Lake of Mansarovar (Mansaroar), the supposed source of the Karnali or Ghaghara River. It is unlikely that Tiefenthaler actually ever say Mansarovar as this lake is located high on the Tibetan Plateau which, during this historic period, was closed to foreigners.  Figure IV is another Indian chart focusing on the secondary sources around the volcano of Doulou Bassandar.  Figure V shows a secondary source for the Ghaghara as it runs through the Himalayas.  Figure VI depicts earlier misconceptions regarding the source of the Ganges as suggested by P. Souciet in his 1729 four volume work  Observations, Mathematical, Astronomical, Geographica, Chronological, and Physical .    One of the most striking elements of this map is the inclusion of Pesian text in each of the maps Tiefenthaler claims to have copied from indigenous sources.   These text blocks are vaguely transliterated and translated into French in a table in the upper left quadrant.  The is the only European map of India we are aware of to incorporate Persian text.   Most of the cartographic work that led to this map was completed by Tiefenthaler in India.  Tiefenthaler, near the end of his life, forwarded it to his friend and fellow orientalist Anquetil-Duperron, living at the time in Paris.  Duperron, a noted orientalist, compiled Tiefenthaler’s research and sketches into this important independently issued map.

The curious undersea mountain ranges displayed here was drawn by Abbe Mongez to illustrate the geographical theories of Peter Simon Pallas, a German polymath living in Russia, who speculated that mountain ranges originated from a series of interterrestial explosions (volcanoes), many of which are noted on the map as asterisks.  Aside from Pallas’s unusual marine topography, this map follows many of the speculative cartographic conventions of the late 18th century.  These include the presence of a large inland sea in the western part of North America, a series of navigable channels in modern day Canada (harkening to the mythical Admiral De Fonte’s journals), and a mountainous Nile source in Africa.  Van Diemen’s Land or Tasmania is attached to the mainland of Australia.  A southern continent is only tenuously suggested by two speculative landmasses shown in the southern Indian Ocean and just south of Tierra del Fuego.  This map was first drawn by Abbe Mongez, then engraved by Ambrose Tardieu for inclusion as title plate, number 0, or folio 1 in Mentelle’s 1779  Atlas Universel   A curious side note.   The Abbe Mongez, who drew this map, was the geologist and naturalist on La Perouse’s ill-fated expedition to the Pacific.

N. Bellin’s 1778 nautical chart of the world.   Presents the entire world on a Mercator Projection based on a Paris (L’Isle de Fer) meridian.   This is notably the first state of this important map, exhibiting a pre-Cook geography throughout, but most specifically in the Pacific and along the northwest coast of America.  North America to the west of the Mississippi is vaguely rendered according to 16th century expeditions into the region by Coronado, La Salle, De Soto, and others.  Bellin identifies the semi-mythical civilizations of Quivira and Teguayo, both associated with legends of the Seven Cities of Gold, in what is modern day Utah, California, and Nevada.  Along the western coast the strait discovered by Martin Aguilar is noted.  Further north still the River of the West (Fl. de l’Ouest) extends from the west coast to the Lake of the Woods (Lac de Bois) and thence via additional waterways to the Great Lakes and the Atlantic.    The River of the West appeared in many 18th century maps of the Americas and is reflective of French hopes for a water route from their colonies in Canada and Louisiana to the Pacific.  Still further north the coastline becomes extremely vague, in places vanishing altogether.  The Aleutians are vaguely rendered according to various sightings by Vitus Jonassen Bering and Aleksei Chirikov in the 1740s and identified as the “Archipel de Nord”.  In the Pacific, various Polynesian Island groups are noted though many are slightly or significantly misplaced.  The Solomon Islands are vastly oversized referencing the early 17th claims of Quiros. The other lands discovered and erroneously mapped by Quiros in 1606 and Davis in 1686 during their search of the great southern continent are also noted.  Hawaii, as yet undiscovered, is absent.  New Zealand is rendered twice though is accurate in its form and position.  Australia, here labeled “Nouvelle Holland”, has part of its southern coastline ghosted in and Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) is attached to the mainland.  The southern coast of New Guinea is similarly ghosted in, suggesting its unexplored state.  It is of interest that there is a common misconception regarding this map that suggests the first edition was dated 1748.  There are editions with a printed date of 1748, but these are actually later editions.  The 1748 date is a printing error in which “8” and “4” are transposed, the actual date of publication being 1784.  The first edition of this map is the 1778 example shown here.",1778 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/bellin.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/World-bellin-1778.jpg,World-bellin-1778,27.5,19.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Asia-lizars-1820,Antique Map: 1820 Lizars Wall Map of Asia (in two panels),Asia.,"An extremely appealing large format c. 1820 map of Asia rendered in two panels.  Truly one of the most beautiful large format maps of Asia to appear in an early 19th century atlas.  Drawn by Daniel Lizars this map covers from the Mediterranean to the Sea of Kamchatka (top panel) and from the Red Sea to Japan (bottom panel). The map further extends north as far as the Arctic and south as far as Ceylon and Borneo.  Stylistically this map follows the conventions established by Thomson, Pinkerton, and Cary at the turn of the 18th century, especially with regard to coloration, border design, typography, and topographic schemes.  Cartographically, while ostensibly similar to earlier 19th century mappings of Asia, Lizars does incorporate a number of advances most of which are derived from Russian surveys in Siberia and Central Asia, as well as nautical expeditions to the Russian Arctic, most specifically around New Siberia and the Liakhov islands.   In India, evidence of British cartographic work of the late 18th century, particularly that of Rennell, is apparent.   Persia, Arabia, and the Near East clearly benefit from Ottoman mapping efforts.  The remainder of the map reveals just how extremely scarce information about Asia was even in the early 19th century.   Along the coasts of Japan and Korea Lizars references Janson’s 17th century maps.  Lizars’ Central Asia is based on even earlier cartographic information dating to Marco Polo and the Mongol Empire. Even the old capital of the Khans, Karakorum, is noted.  China is correctly divided into China Proper, and the greater Chinese sphere of influence, here called the Chinese Empire, stretching from the Kashgar to Korea, inclusive of Tibet.  Southeast Asia is weakly mapped though does represent the regions before significant colonization efforts by the British in Burma and the French in Vietnam and Cambodia.  Furthermore, this map was clearly drawn during a period of Burmese ascendance with the Birman Empire embracing all of modern day Burma and Thailand.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Nansenbushu-rokashihotan-1710,"Antique Map: 1710 First Japanese Buddhist Map of the World Showing Europe, America,  and Africa",Nansenbushu Bankoku Shoka No Zu  (Outline Map of All Countries of the Universe),"A seminal map of extreme significance. This is the first Japanese printed map to depict the world, including Europe and America, from a Buddhist cosmographical perspective.   Printed by woodblock in 1710 (Hoei 7), this map was composed by the Buddhist monk Rokashi Hotan.  Inspired by the 1653 publication of  Si-yu-ki, a pilgrimage narrative of the Chinese monk Hsuang-Tsang's (602-604) travels to India  in search of sacred Sanskrit writings,  Rokashi Hotan's map attempts to update Buddhist mythological cartography, as exemplified in the 1634 manuscript map Gotenjikuzu (Map of the Five Regions of India), to correspond with the Si-yu-ki, as well as with contemporary and ancient religious texts, Chinese annals, travel narratives, and even some European maps.   Rokashi Hotan lists these texts, 102 in all, at the top of the map.  The consequent product of Rokashi Hotan's work is this magnificent amalgam of disparate ideas and traditions.    In essence this is a traditional Buddhist world view in the Gotenjikuzu mold centered on the world spanning continent of Jambu-Dvipa.  At its center is Lake Anavatapta, a whirlpool-like quadruple helix lake believed to be the center of the universe.    This lake, which is commonly associated with Lake Manasarovar in northern India, is believed in Buddhist mythology to be the legendary site where Queen Maya conceived the Buddha.  From the quadruple beast headed helix (heads of a horse, a lion, an elephant, and an ox) of Manasarovar or Lake Anavatapta radiates the four sacred rivers of the region: the Indus, the Ganges, the Bramaputra, and the Sutlej.   South of Jambu-Dvipa, India is recognizable for in its peninsular form.  Japan itself appears as a series of Islands in the upper right and, like India, is one of the few recognizable elements - at least from a cartographic perspective.  China and Korea appear to the west of Japan and are vaguely identifiable geographically, which itself represents a significant advancement over the Gotenjikuzu map.  Southeast Asia also makes one of its first appearances in a Japanese Buddhist map as an island cluster to the east of India.   On the opposite side of the map a series of islands is intended to represent Europe, which had no place at all in earlier Buddhist world maps, making this one of the first Japanese maps to depict Europe.  Umukari (Hungary), Oranda, Baratan, Komo (Holland or the country of the red hair), Arubaniya (Albania?), Itarya (Italy), Suransa (France) and Inkeresu (England) are all named.    Africa appears as a small island in the western sea identified as the Land of Western Women.   Of special note is Rokashi Hotan's mapping of the Americas.  Prior to this map America had rarely if ever been depicted on Japanese maps, so Rokashi Hotan turned to the Chinese map Daimin Kyuhen Zu (Map of China under the Ming Dynasty and its surrounding Countries), from which he copied both the small island-like form of  South America (just south of Japan), and the curious land bridge (the Aleutian Islands?) connecting Asia to what the Japanese historians Nobuo Muroga and Kazutaka Unno conclude must undoubtedly be a reflection of North America (page 63).  Whether this represents ancient knowledge from early Chinese navigations in this region, for which there is some literary if not historical evidence, or merely a printing error, we can only speculate.   While this map represents a significant step forward in the Japanese attempt to combine religious and contemporary geographic knowledge it remains in essence a Buddhist map.  It is likely that Rokashi Hotan was aware important European style maps circulating in China at the time.  The Mateo Ricci Map is one such example and copies were known to have reached Japan in the 17th century.",1710 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/rokashihotan.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/Nansenbushu-rokashihotan-1710.jpg,Nansenbushu-rokashihotan-1710,56.5,45

Presented on a Mercator projection, this map marks a significant advancement in Japanese globular cartography and a far more sophisticated adaptation of western cartographic standards than is evidenced in most earlier Japanese world maps.   No longer reliant on 17th century Dutch maps acquired via the Dutch East India Company’s (VOC) trade concession in Nagasaki, the Japanese have here abandoned many of the antiquated cartographic notions, such as an insular California, which were common in Japanese maps of the previous decade.  Japanese cartographers may have been motivated to update their traditional world view in the light of the explosion of cartographic ideas associated with the arrival in Edo Harbor of the American Commodore Matthew Perry in the same year this map was published.  As a whole this map offers a sophisticated cartographic presentation of the world embracing the most up to date cartographic knowledge available in the mid-19th century.   Though adapted to the Japanese printing style, this map presents a generally accurate world view.  British Claims to Washington and British Columbia are noted in North America, Australia and the Pacific are accurately rendered, as are the discoveries of Vitus Bering and James Cook in the Arctic, and Africa is clearly pre-Speke.   The disputed East Sea / Sea of Japan / Sea of Korea is here labeled as the Sea of Joseon (Korea), which some scholars suggests indicates Japanese acceptance of the “Sea of Korea” convention.  Four hemispheres appear in the lower left quadrant, from left, the southern, northern, eastern, and western.  All are on a stereographic  projection.     The map is printed on woodblock and hand colored in vivid, blues, greens, oranges, and yellows.

The map covers the entire archipelago and the surrounding seas featuring countless depth soundings, four compass tables, and some topographical detail.  Like most Japanese nautical charts used during World War II, this map is an amalgam of American and British hydrographic efforts.  In this case, the map is cartographically derived from a 1933 United States Naval Chart; however, other dates on the map suggest that it was updated by the Japanese to 1939 – making it very interesting indeed.  A close examination of the island of Oahu shows three sites underlined in period red pencil:  Honolulu, Honolulu Harbor, and Pearl City (Pearl Harbor).   Could this chart have been used to plan or execute the 1941 Pearl Harbor Attack that forced a U.S. hand in World War II?  While there is no hard evidence that this is the case, the indirect evidence is suggestive.  This chart is a Japanese military issue map of the period.  The target areas are highlighted and this chart features both nautical and aeronautical elements.    The likelihood, given the underlines and this document’s military nature, that this chart or one like it was used to plan or execute the Pearl Harbor Attack is extremely high.

Based on a drawing composed by the Swedish naval officer Baron Axel Leonhard Klinkowström on his 1818 – 1820 tour of the United States.  Klinkowström was sent to New York to assess the strategic value of the newly invented steam ship for the use by the Swedish Navy.  Accordingly this stunning view shows an assortment of sail and steam ships plying the New York Harbor.  Stokes notes that this “view is interesting particularly as showing the types of steam ferries and sail-boats in use at this period.”  No description of this print, however, is more compelling than the author’s own:  The harbor is full of small sailing vessels, yachts, and schooners which come from all America’s ports to this mid-point of all movement. Usually these ships are well-painted and are built in a light and handsome style. The steamboats which come and go like stagecoaches add great activity to this picture. Behind the city itself the great Hudson River empties into the harbor, which is large and reaches as far as New Jersey. This grand panorama is bounded by the New Jersey coast and the highlands on the other side of the Hudson.   Modern New Yorkers may have a hard time recognizing this 19th century variant their fair city,  but the steeples of Trinity Church and St. Paul’s Chapel are clearly visible as are many of the docks and harbor buildings of what can only be South Street Seaport.

This map includes the modern day states of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio as well as parts of Ontario and Quebec.   The most interesting parts of this map are the north-western quadrants which are dedicated to the Great Lakes and the North Western Territory.  The Great Lakes are rendered in accordance with the research produced by D. W. Smith, the surveyor General of Upper Canada, who was assigned to survey Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Erie in the late 18th century.  In modern day Ohio, Connecticut’s Western Reserve is noted.  The reserve, formally ceded to Connecticut after the Yankee-Pennamite Wars, was the last remnant of Connecticut’s old colonial grant of all territory, from sea-to-sea, falling between the 41st and 42nd parallels.  This map also includes numerous references to the American Indian nations occupying the region, including the Chippewa, the Ottawa, and the Six Nations.   The “Indian Boundary” is shown bisecting the North West Territory.  Created by General Wayne’s treaty of 1795, this boundary line proposed to denotes the southern limit of American Indian lands in the North Western Territory.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/World-zahn-1696,Antique Map: 1696 Zahn Map of the World in Two Hemispheres,Facies una Hemi-sphaerii Terrestris.  Facies Altern Hemi-sphaerii Terrestris.,"An extremely rare discovery, this is a wonderful 1693 double hemisphere map of the world in two panels.  Both of these maps were drawn and engraved by the German Enlightenment era polymath Johann Zahn for his pseudo-scientific opus  Mundus Mirabili , or the “Marvelous World.”  This, Zahn’s cartographic masterpiece, is a smorgasbord of carto-curiosity featuring such unusual elements as an insular California, the Great Lakes rendered as a single body of water open to the west, the strait of Anian far to the north, El Dorado or Manoa on the shores of the mythical Lake Parima, the legendary Lago de los Xarayes, an erroneously oriented Caspian Sea, a speculative Ptolemaic mapping of the sources of the Nile, an incomplete Australia, and the five great rivers of southeast Asia radiating from a single apocryphal lake , among others.  Our survey of this map will begin with North America on the western hemisphere sheet.  North America is rendered according to the common 17th century Dutch conception and owes much to the work of Nicholas Visscher whose maps played a significant role in promoting the “California as an Island” hypothesis. The concept of an insular California first appeared as a work of fiction in Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo's c. 1510 romance Las Sergas de Esplandian, where he writes   Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons.  Baja California was subsequently discovered in 1533 by Fortun Ximenez, who had been sent to the area by Hernan Cortez. When Cortez himself traveled to Baja, he must have had Montalvo's novel in mind, for he immediately claimed the Island of California for the Spanish King. By the late 16th and early 17th century ample evidence had been amassed, through explorations of the region by Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcon, and others, that California was in fact a peninsula. However, by this time other factors were in play. Francis Drake had sailed north and claimed New Albion near modern day Washington or Vancouver for England. The Spanish thus needed to promote Cortez's claim on the Island of California to preempt English claims on the western coast of North America. The significant influence of the Spanish crown on European cartographers caused a major resurgence of the Insular California theory. About half a century after this map was drawn Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, published his own 1705 account of travels overland from Mexico to California, establishing conclusively the peninsularity of California.  Zahn’s rendering of the Great Lakes as a single body of water open to the west is of particular interest and is the most ephemeral element of this map, being updated in most subsequent maps to reflect ongoing European exploration of the region. At first glance Zahn’s great inland sea appears uncannily like Verazanno’s Sea, a 16th century speculative body of water extending to the Pacific through the center of North America, which was no doubt a direct influence on the water form established here.  Subsequent mapping of this region would see this great inland sea replaced by more contemporary rendering of the Great Lakes taken from the explorations of La Salle, Hennepin, and others.  North of insular California we find the land of Anian, separated from the North American mainland by a narrow strait. Anian is generally considered to be an undiscovered land or strait in the extreme northwestern part of America. The earliest known reference to Anian is in the narratives of Marco Polo, who describes it as “East of India”. In many early maps Anian appears as an imaginary proto-Bearing Strait, the Strait of Anian, separating Asia from America.  Zahn’s treatment of Anian is unusual.",1696 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/zahn.txt,"Zahn, J., <i>Mundus Mirabili</i>, vol II, (Nuremburg) 1696.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/World-zahn-1696.jpg,World-zahn-1696,34,14.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/BritishColonies-phelippeaux-1779,Antique Map: 1779 Phelippeaux Case Map of the United States during the Revolutionary War,Carte Generale Des Colonies Angloises Dans L'Amerique Septentrionale.,"This is an important and extremely rare 1779 case map of the English colonies in in North America at the height of the American Revolutionary War.   Focusing on the English Colonies, this map covers the eastern part of North America from the Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, extending westward as far as modern day Galveston.  Rene Phelippeaux and Brion de la Tour issued this map following the 1778 signing of the Treaty of Alliance between France and the fledgling United States, which brought the American Revolutionary effort to the attention of the French public.  Cartographically this map is based upon the important John Mitchell map of 1755.  As a whole it presents the colonies in superb detail, identifying cities and towns, forts, roads, Indian villages and tribal territory, and coastal shoals and banks.  Curiously this map attempts to offer both a French and an English mapping of the region.  Phelippeaux presents French Louisiana extending eastwards as far as the Appellation Mountains and westward well into territories claimed by Spain, however, it also shows the original Carolina grant from the British crown extending westward to the edge of the map.   The fact that Louisiana west of the Mississippi had been ceded to Spain following the French and Indian War does not seem to be acknowledged.  What is acknowledged is the cession of Upper Louisiana, north of 40 degrees latitude and east of the Mississippi, to the British under the 1763 Treaty of Paris.  This important treaty effectively gave the British control of the lucrative fur trade in the upper Mississippi Valley and eventually gave rise to the North West Company and the era of the Mountain Men in the early years of the 19th century.  This map is also of particular significance for those interested in the history of the Great Lakes.  In Lake Superior the ghost islands of Phelipeaux (no relation to our author) and Pontchartrain are noted.  These apocryphal islands first appeared in a 1744 map by Nicholas Bellin and were later picked up by Mitchell for inclusion in his monumental map of the British Colonies in America.  Following the Revolutionary War the 1783 Treaty of Paris used the islands to form the official border between the United States and Canada as a transient “by Lake Superior north of the islands and royal Phelipeaux to Long Lake.”  It was not until the official U.S. – Canada border surveys of 1820 that the existence of these islands was finally brought into question.  Texas is defined as the Pays de Cenis, referring to the Cenis tribe which, from the 16th through the 18th centuries, was one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the American southwest.  Known for their hospitality towards European travelers, the Cenis are remembered for amicably hosting La Salle, Onate, Coronado, and other early explorers.  In fact, in the Cenis language the word for welcome is “Techas, Techas”, meaning “friend”.  Eventually “Techas” become known as “Tejas” and, in time, “Texas”.  With the French and subsequent American settlement of Louisiana, as well as the exodus of the Natchez and Chocktaw from Alabama, the Cenis were confined to a smaller and smaller territory surrounding the Trinity (Trinidad) River – as their villages are shown here.   Eventually the remaing Cenis and a large group of emigrating tribes met in a great battle on the Bank of the Trinity in which the Cenis nation was utterly destroyed.  It is also noteworthy that this map is published in an unusual dissected folding format, commonly called case format. While common in the 19th century, dissected case format maps are rare in 18th century due to this format rendering the map less durable than traditional book-format binding.    All and all, this map is wonderful discovery and an important addition to any Revolutionary War themed map collection.  Published by Esnauts et Rapilly, rue st. Jacques, a la Ville de Coutances, Paris, 1779. Exceedingly rare in all editions.",1778 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/phelippeaux.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/BritishColonies-phelippeaux-1779.jpg,BritishColonies-phelippeaux-1779,31,20.5
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SanDiego-victoria-1825,"Antique Map: 1825 Victoria Map of San Diego, California and San Blas, Mexico",Plano del Puerto de San Diego de la California Septentrional.  Plano del Puerto de San Blas en Las Costas del Estado de Xalisco.,"This is an exceptionally rare and early map of San Diego Bay, California, and San Blas, Mexico, published in 1825 by order of Senor Don Guadalupe Victoria, the first president of the Republic of Mexico.  Essentially two maps on a single sheet, this map highlights the starting point (San Blas) an ending point (San Diego) of the Spanish supply route to southern California.  The upper map focuses on San Diego Bay, covering the region from Puerto Falso (Mission Harbor) to Punta de Arena.  The fortress of San Diego (the Presidio), the Ranchera de Choyas, the Poblacion of San Diego (Mission of San Diego), and a ranch and Indian village in the southwestern part of the bay, among other sites, are all noted.  The lower map, focusing on San Blas details the Bay from the Rio de Santiago to the village of San Blas, today a small fishing village near Puerto Vallarta.  Both maps offer numerous depth soundings, references to shoals, reefs, and other undersea dangers, and notes on anchorage.  The armorial crest of Mexico appears in the lower left quadrant.  Though ostensibly similar to the map of the same regions published by Perouse in his 1797 atlas, this is in truth a different map with the apparent similarity stemming from  the fact that both maps are drawn from the same source – the pioneering cartography of Juan Pantoja y Arrianga.   Pantoja was the navigator and cartographer of the Frigate Princesa, which was commissioned, in 1782 to supply Spain’s few colonial outposts along the remote California coastline.  The Princesa sailed from the harbor of San Blas to San Diego where, during a seven week break, Pantoja produced the first accurate survey of San Diego Bay.  Pantoja’s work remained in manuscript form until 1802 when it was published to illustrated Espinosa and Tello's  Relacion Del Viage Hecho Por Las Goletas Sutil Y Mexicana En El Ano De 1792.   Around this time the Spanish government, looking to firm its holdings on the California coast, commissioned a series of nautical charts based on Pantoja’s work.  The 1810  El Grito , which set off the Mexican Independence movement, halted most Spanish financed map publication work in the Americas.  It was left to Mexico’s first president Senor Don Guadalupe Victoria to resurrect Spain’s abandoned cartographic effort and finally publish this important map series.    The Los Angeles Bookseller Jake Zeitlin claimed that this map was published in London by John Arrowsmith.  While Arrowsmith’s name does not appear on the work, the quality of the paper and the exceptionally fine engraving is definitely suggestive of a well-established European publishing house. No similar work of this quality is evident from either Mexican or American publishers of the period.  This map is extremely scarce and we know of only four other examples in institutional collections:  the Bancroft Library, The Huntington Library, the University of Arizona, and the U.C. San Diego Campus Library.",1825 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/victoria.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/SanDiego-victoria-1825.jpg,SanDiego-victoria-1825,15,21

Feuille.,"This is a fine example of La Perouse’s important 1787 mapping of Vancouver Island and the coastlines of Washington and British Columbia.  When drawn in 1787 La Perouse’s map was the only available map of this region not based on the survey work of Captain Cook.  The map covers the coastline from Cape Rond (Tillamook Head, Oregon) northwards past Vancouver Island as far the northwestern top of the Baie de Clonard (The Queen Charlotte Islands or Haida Gwaii).  The cartography here may be a little hard to understand for most casual observers due Perouse’s use of archaic French language place names and well as a number of major errors.  Perouse, like Cook, entirely missed the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, consequently Vancouver Island is erroneously attached to the mainland.  Nonetheless, many of the sites visited by early explorers, including the Nootka Sound, the Bay of St. Louis (Quatsino Sound), Pointe Boisee (Cape Cook), Mont Fleurieu (Silverthrone Mountain), Cape Fleurieu (Goose Island), Cap Hector (Cape St. James), and many others are noted. Cartographically Perouse’s mapping of this region, though still quite incomplete, is a major advancement over the work of Cook who after leaving Nootka Sound was forced offshore by stormed and skipped much of the coast until he reached Alaska near Sitka.  This is thus the first chart to map the British Columbia coastline between 49°34' and 57°.  In its day the importance of this chart went largely unknown for, though the survey work and original engraving date to 1786, the atlas of La Perouse’s discoveries was not officially published until 1798, by which time other more advances mappings of the region had reached the mainstream.

Though minimalist this map exhibits one of the most important early surveys of San Francisco Bay.  La Perouse spent roughly 10 days surveying San Francisco Bay making numerous improvements over Jose de Canizares’ 1776  Plano del Puerto de Sn. Francisco . Skirting the coast, La Perouse also identifies a number of important landmarks including Cape Mendocino, Port de La Trinite, Cap Blanc (Cape Blanco), and others.

No.2 20 of theHudson River Port Folio.  Published by Henry I. Megarey New York.","A rare find, this is plate no. 20 from William G. Wall, and Henry L. Megarey’s important 1825 Hudson River Port Folio.  The Hudson River Port Folio is considered to be the first and finest set of views of the Hudson River ever published.  The Port Folio consists of 20 aquatint views of the Hudson River as it traverses some 315 miles from the Adirondacks to New York City.   This, the 20th and final view in the series is considered to be the most desirable for its early and important depiction of New York City.    This widely popular serious was instrumental in fostering the development of the Hudson River School of painting.  The portfolio was based upon a series of watercolors by the Dublin-born artist William Guy Wall.   The New York publisher Henry Megarey hired John Hill to create a series of aquatints based upon Wall’s work.  The result, published between 1821 and 1825, was a cost effective and popular series of views that led to widespread appreciation for the American indigenous landscape.  Examples of the Hudson River Portfolio were issued in three editions, with some examples being hand colored by the publisher and some issued without color.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/CentralPark-knapp-1870,"Antique Map: 1870 Vaux and Olmstead Map of Central Park, New York City",Map of the Central Park January 1st 1870.,"An altogether extraordinary hand colored map of New York City’s Central Park prepared and printed for inclusion in the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Central Park. This is an extremely rare variant on the map of Central Park that originally appeared in the 1862 Commissioner’s Report. Depicts the park as a whole and includes pathways, lakes, buildings, individual trees, rocks, and elevation measurements. The streets and avenues surrounding the park as well as the tramways that existed at the time are also noted.  This extraordinary map reveals Central Park as conceived by the Landscape Architects, and indeed “artists”, Vaux and Olmstead. Vaux and Olmstead were awarded the task of designing Central Park in 1853 by the City Common Council. Olmstead’s vision drove the overall design while Vaux concentrated his attentions on bridges, buildings, and other structures within the park. The creation of Central Park, which was to consist of some 800 acres of public forest, pathways, promenades, lakes, bridges, and meadows, was a seminal moment in civic urban design. The park itself was designed as a whole with every tree, pond, and bench meticulously planned. Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Historian Gloria Deak writes, “There was a staggering amount of work to be done to transform the area into a blend of pastoral and woodland scenery. This involved the design and construction of roadways, tunnels, bridges, arches, stairways, fountains, benches, lamp posts, gates, fences and innumerable other artifacts. It also involved the supervision of an army of about five thousand laborers…Olmsted, to whom most of the credit goes, insisted on seeing the multidimensional project as a single work of art, which he was mandated to create. For this purpose, he ventured to assume to himself the title of ‘artist.’” Today, because of Vaux and Olmstead’s efforts, New York Yorkers, ourselves included, have the privilege of enjoying what is, perhaps, the finest example of a planned urban public recreation area in the world.",1870 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/olmstead.txt,"<i>Thirteenth Annual Report of the Commissioners of the Central Park</i>, (New York) 1870.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/CentralPark-knapp-1870.jpg,CentralPark-knapp-1870,35.5,10

","A rare and unusual map of upper Manhattan, New York City, prepared and printed for inclusion in the 1870 Thirteenth Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Central Park.   Depicts the island of Manhattan north of 155th street including the districts of Inwood, Harlem, and Washington Heights.   The plan for much of Manhattan, south of 155th street, was originally laid out by John Randel in his 1811 Map of the City of New York or as it is otherwise known the “Commissioner’s Plan”.   This ambitions project transformed nearly 12,000 acres of wilderness into a massive urban grid.  Nonetheless, by 1860, New York City’s development had exceeded even Randel’s expectations.  The Central Park Commission was granted the responsibility of laying out the systematic street gird and public areas of the undeveloped parts of Manhattan northwards of 155th street.  Consequently the 1870 13th Annual Commissioner’s Report included this map which offers considerable detail regarding proposed street layouts, waterways, and public areas, both proposed and developed.  Also depicts the suggested bulkhead development extending the shoreline along both the eastern and western parts of Manhattan Island.  When this map was made much of this region remained undeveloped farmland and semi-suburban properties, as is reflected by some of the topography and buildings indicated, especially in the western part of the city.  Numerous individual buildings are sketched in if not specifically described.  Also apparent is the newly developed 11th Avenue, a critical artery connecting lower Manhattan with the Harlem and Hudson waterways in the northern part of the city.

Olmstead wrote: “Every foot of the parks surface, every tree and bush, as well as every arch, roadway, and walk and been placed where it is for a purpose.”  Though Olmstead is best known for his work in New York's Central Park, there are many who consider Prospect Park, his second masterpiece, to be his finest.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NovaVirginiaeTabula-hondius-1630,Antique Map: 1630 Hondius Map of Virginia and the Chesapeake,Nova Virginiae Tabula.,"A very fine example of Henricus Hondius’ 1630 map of the Virginia colony and the Chesapeake Bay.  Oriented to the west, this map covers from Cape Henry to the Susquehanna River and inland as far as the Appellation Mountains.  The Chesapeake Bay is shown in full as are many of its river estuaries, though topographically this map places a number of mountain ranges where there are in fact none.  Cartographically this map is based upon John Smith’s landmark map of the Virginia colony issued in 1612.  Smith’s fine survey work, as well as reports from indigenous American Indian tribes, and fanciful wishful thinking, combine to make this one of the most interesting maps of America to emerge in the 17th century.  Philip D. Burden, the author of The Mapping of America, considers this map,  Nova Virginiae Tabula , to be one of the most important maps of America ever produced and certainly one of the greatest influence.  To fully understand this map one must first realize that most Europeans believed the Pacific, or at least some great bay that led to the Pacific, lay just a few days travel inland. In the minds of most Europeans of the period, the trade potential for the Virginia colony was entirely dependent upon it being a practical access point to the riches of Asia. Thus the significance of large and mysterious body of water appearing in the land of the Massawomecks, in the upper right quadrant, becomes apparent.  Of course, much of this land was entirely unexplored by the European settlers in Jamestown, shown here on the Powhatan River (James River), who relied heavily upon American Indian reports for much of their cartographic knowledge of the Virginia hinterlands.  The Masawomecks themselves were a rival of the Powhatan and made their home near the headwaters of the Potomac.  These, like many other indigenous groups of the region made only a brief and frequently violent appearance during the 17th century before entirely disappearing, mostly from disease and war, in the early 18th century.  In the upper left quadrant there is an image of the American Indian chief of the Powhatan sitting enthroned before a great fire in his long house.  One of the more popular legends regarding John Smith was is capture and trial before the chief of the Powahatan.  Smith was convinced that his liberation had something to do with the youthful daughter of Chief Powahatan, Pocahontas, taking a liking to him. Though this grew into a fictious legend of its own, the truth is more likely that Powhatan saw Smith and his Englishmen as potential allies against the rival American Indian groups, such as the Massawomecks, that were pressing hard against his borders.   There are a number of different editions of this map and its publication by various map houses in various states made it the first widely distributed map of the Virginia colony and of John Smith’s important map.  There was, however, a scandal relating to its publication.  The map was originally drawn and engraved in 1618 by Jodocus Hondius based upon the first edition of John Smith’s 1612 map.  When Jodocus died in 1629, he and his brother, Henricus Hondius, while collaborating on the Hondius  Atlas Major , had established and maintained separate business for some 10 years.  Jodocus’ death enabled the competing cartographer, Willem Blaeu to acquire a large number of Jodocus’ map plates, which he promptly published in 1630 as the  Atlantis Appendix .  Henricus, in the meantime, had been counting on Jodocus’ new plates to enhance his own, by then outdated, Hondius  Atlas Major .  A surviving contract dated March 2, 1630 reveals that Henricus Hondius and his partner Joannes Janssonius hired engravers to produce a number of new map plates copying the work of Jodocus – now in the hands of the Blaeu firm.  This map was among the most important on that list and accounts for the quantity of variants of this map issued by competing Blaeu and Hondius firms.",1630 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/hondius.txt,"Hondius, H., <i>Atlas Major</i>, 1630.",http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/NovaVirginiaeTabula-hondius-1630.jpg,NovaVirginiaeTabula-hondius-1630,19.5,15.5

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NovaBelgicaetAngliaNova-blaeu-1635,Antique Map: 1635 Blaeu Map of New England and New York (1st depiction of Manhattan as an Island),Nova Belgica et Anglia Nova.,"A beautiful old color example of one of the most important maps in the history of America, Blaeu’s c. 1635  Nova Belgica et Anglia Nova .  Oriented to the west, this map covers the American coast from Virginia, past New York and Long Island to Cape Code, New England, and Quebec.  It is cartographically derived from data accumulated by Adriaen Bock and other Dutch fur traders active in the early 17th century.   It is known for a number of important firsts, including the first full representation of Manhattan as an Island.    Burden, in his  Mapping of North America , notes:  This important map was one of the most attractive of the Americas at the time. It is noted for the fact that its primary source is the first manuscript figurative map of Adriaen Block, 1614.  Indeed it is the first full representation of it in print.  It is one of the earliest to name Nieu Amsterdam. Block, a Dutch fur trader, explored the area between Cape Cod and Manhattan, examining the bays and rivers along the way. This helped to create an accurate picture of the longitudinal scale of the coastline. His manuscript map is the first document to delineate an insular Manhattan; it also provides the earliest appearance of Manhates and Niev Nederland.   It has been noted that the time difference between 1614, the date of the manuscript, and Blaeu's map whose first appearance is in 1635, appears long for such an important advance. It would seem highly feasible that Blaeu, who published many separately issued maps, would have wanted to produce one like this sooner. However, evidence points to the fact that it could not have been made before 1630. The Stokes Collection in New York possesses an example of the map on thicker paper without text on the reverse which could well be a proof issue of some kind.   There are features on Blaeu's map that differ from the Block chart. Some of these could be accounted for by the fact that the surviving figurative map is not the original, and that the copyist omitted some place names that are referred to in the text of de Laet's work. Block drew on Champlain's map of 1612 for the depiction of the lake named after him, but it is here called Lacus Irocoisiensis. …  The lack of interrelation between the Dutch or English colonies and the French, led for some time to the eastward displacement of this lake when its true position would be north of the Hudson River.   Some nomenclature has its origins in Blaeu's second Paskaert of c.1630, and others, such as Manatthans, in de Laet. The colony of Nieu Pleimonth is identified. This and other English names along that part of the coast are largely derived from Smith's New England, 1616. Cape Cod is here improved over the Block manuscript by being reconnected to the mainland, the narrow strait having been removed. The coastline between here and Narragansett Bay, which can be clearly recognized, is not so accurate. Adriaen Blocx Eylandt leads us to the Versche Rivier, or Connecticut River, which Block ascended as far as was possible. 't Lange Eyland is named; however, it is incorrectly too far east, being applied to what is possibly Fishers Island. De Groote bay marks Long Island Sound. The Hudson River is still not named as such, but is littered with Dutch settlements, and the failed Fort Nassau is here depicted renamed as Fort Orange. He does, however, improve on the direction of its flow. Blaeu separates the sources of the Hudson and Delaware Rivers which had been causing some confusion. Nieu Amsterdam is correctly marked as a fort at the tip of an island separated on the east side by Hellegat, or the East River. The coastline south of Sandy Hook also shows signs of improvement.   The whole map is adorned by deer, foxes, bears, egrets, rabbits, cranes and turkeys. Beavers, polecats and otters appear on a printed map for the first time.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/WereltCaert-stoopendaal-1730,Antique Map: 1730 Stoopendaal Map of the World in two Hemispheres,Werelt Caert.,"A fine 1730 world map was drawn by Daniel Stoopendaal for publication in the Keur Bible.  Based on Visscher’s very similar map of 1663, this map depicts the world on a hemisphere projection surrounded by stunning allegorical cartouche work.  The cartouche work corresponds to that seen on the second world Bible map produced by Nicolaas Visscher,  Orbis Terrarum Tabula Recens Emendata ... (Shirley 431, 1663), though the map has changed to accommodate evolving geographical suppositions. Stoopendaal revisions of Visscher’s work include geographical updates as well as the incorporation of Copernican and Ptolemaic solar systems in the place of Visscher’s polar projections – though curiously Visscher’s labels remain.  Cartographically Stoopendaal probably references Pieter Goos world map of 1666,  Orbis Terrarum Nova Et Accuratissima Tabula ... (Shirley 438), to which this map is similar. .  Our survey of this map will begin in North America where Stoopendaal has updated Visscher’s model to incorporate the convention of a flat topped insular California.  The concept of an insular California first appeared as a work of fiction in Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo's c. 1510 romance Las Sergas de Esplandian, where he writes  Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons.  Baja California was subsequently discovered in 1533 by Fortun Ximenez, who had been sent to the area by Hernan Cortez. When Cortez himself traveled to Baja, he must have had Montalvo's novel in mind, for he immediately claimed the Island of California for the Spanish King. By the late 16th and early 17th century ample evidence had been amassed, through explorations of the region by Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcon, and others, that California was in fact a peninsula. However, by this time other factors were in play. Francis Drake had sailed north and claimed New Albion near modern day Washington or Vancouver for England. The Spanish thus needed to promote Cortez's claim on the Island of California to preempt English claims on the western coast of North America. The significant influence of the Spanish crown on European cartographers caused a major resurgence of the Insular California theory. Around the same time this map was drawn Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, published his own 1705 account of travels overland from Mexico to California, establishing conclusively the peninsularity of California.  Stoopendaal’s rendering of the Great Lakes as a single body of water open to the west is of particular interest and is the most ephemeral element of this map, being updated in subsequent editions to reflect ongoing European exploration of the region.  The unusual rendering of the Great Lakes shown here is unique to Visscher’s work and appears in several of his maps. At first glance Visscher’s great inland sea appears uncannily like Verazanno’s Sea, a 16th century speculative body of water extending to the Pacific through the center of North America, which was no doubt a direct influence on the water form established here. In some early maps, Visscher describes his inland sea with the following Latin note:   Lacus iste quantum ex accolis colligi potuiy trecenta ut minimum miliaria en longitudinem pateat  This lake, as far as can be learned from the inhabitants, stretches at least three hundred miles in length  This is curiously identical to the text used by Jodocus Hondius on his world map of 1611 to describe his rendering of Verazanno’s Sea.  Later maps would see this great inland sea replaced by more contemporary rendering of the Great Lakes taken from the explorations of La Salle, Hennepin, and others.",1730 (undated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/stoopendaal.txt,"<i>Biblia,dat is De gantsche H.

De L'Academie Royale des Sciences…   America Septentrionalis in Suas Praecipuas  Partes Divisa, ad usum Serenissumu Burgundiae Ducis. ","An extraordinary map, this is Covens and Mortier’s 1708 reissue of De L’Isle’s landmark 1700 mapping of North America.  Covers the continent of North America from the Baffin Bay southwards as far as the Spanish Main, westwards to Cape Mendocino, and eastwards to include the Azores and the Sargasso Sea. Cartographically this map is practically identical to De L’Isle’s map though the title cartouche has been moved to the upper left quadrant and the mile scales to the upper right with a new curtain motif frame.  Tooley, in his  Mapping of America  considers this to be a foundational map and indeed it is one of the most influential maps to emerge from the De L’Isle workshop.     Some consider this map to be one of the first to revert California to a peninsular state following the insular suppositions of the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  However, this may be a misreading of the map.  De L’Isle leaves the northern terminus of the Gulf of California open such that, though the form of California is suggestive of a peninsular state, should exploration prove the opposite, the cartographer was covered.  On the west coast of California a false bay is notated though this may simply be a double mapping of the entrance to the Gulf of California.  Further north along the coast San Diego, Seyo, Cape Mendocin, and Francis Drakes Port, and the English claim of New Albion are noted. Both Mexico and New Mexico are mapped with considerable sophistication with mines, indigenous peoples, mountains and river ways, and the missions of Santa Fe, Taos, and San Antonio de Senecu (El Paso) noted.    The Mississippi valley is well developed and based upon the most advanced French information available at the time.  The forts of St. Louis, Bon Secours are noted, as is the settlement of d’Iberville at Bilochy.  Following the Mississippi north we fine the Great Lakes beautifully drawn on the Coronelli model.  The French stronghold on the region is evident with forts at Tadousac, Quebec, Sorel, Montreal, and Frontenac identified.  In an act of clear carto-advocacy De L’Isle confines the English colonies to the narrow strip of coastal lands east of the Alleghenies. The River and Fort of Kinibeki (Kennebec) is set as the northern border of English holdings in the region.  Boston, Nantucket, Long Island, Manhattan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Jamestown, Roanoke, Charlestown, and St. Augustine, among others, are identified along the eastern seaboard.  At sea there are a couple of elements of note.  This is the first printed mapping of the Sargasso Sea, here identified as the “Mer de Sargasse” where  Icy flottent des herbes mais en montre quantite .  Along the Mexican and California coastline the routes of various navigators including Olivier, Cortez, Gaetan, Mendonza, and Francis Drake are delineated.    Just to the east of Barbados, in the Antilles, a curious apocryphal island appears with the label “I. de Fonseca selon Quelquefuns”.  This island, which is here surrounded by dangerous rocks and reefs, appears in several maps of the region as early as Hondius’  Americae Novissima Descriptio  where is as identified as Y. de S. B. This island was also identified by M. Rochette with the label Galissioniere’s Rock.  Other ships, including the Rainbow, claim to have seen the island as late as 1822.   De L’Isle was the first to give the map a definite name, Fonseca. Even so, with so few sightings of the island it disappeared from most maps issued in the 18th century.  There is some speculation that discolored water occasionally discharged by the nearby Orinoco River led to various false sightings of land.  The condition of this map is of special note as it is nothing short of spectacular.  The impression is so intense it is reminiscent of Coronelli’s work and the overall state of preservation is remarkable.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NieuwVrankryk-hennepin-1688,Antique Map: 1688 Hennepin First Book and Map of North America (first printed map to name Louisiana),"Kaart van Nieuw Vrankryk, en van Louisania Nieuwelyks Ontdekt ","A work that fundamentally impacted the cartographic history of America, this is the 1688 first Dutch edition of Friar Hennepin’s most important work describing his explorations through the Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi valley.  This book includes the first map to name Louisiana as well as some of the earliest descriptions and depictions of the regions, including Niagara Falls.  The enclosed map, entitled  Kaart van Nieuw Vrankryk en van Louisiana , covers all north American from the Strait of Anian and California (which is attached to the mainland) as far east as the Grand Banks, as far north as Lake Assenipoils (Winnipeg), and as far south as Antilles and the Spanish Main.  It also includes Denys’ description of New France and the coasts of North America.  Unlike earlier editions of this work, which only had two image plates (Niagara Falls and a Bison) this edition of Hennepin’s book contains four plates depicting indigenous life and interactions with the explorers.  This book is considered “One of the most important volumes in the early history of North America” (Lande) being the first printed description of La Salle’s explorations.  In 1679 the French lord René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle set out from Fort Frontenac, on Lake Ontario, to explore the Great Lakes and eventually make their way to the Mississippi River.  La Salle was of the belief that the Mississippi connected to other water routes that would eventually lead to the Pacific.  His scribe and chronicler on this expedition was a Dutch Friar of the Franciscan Recollect order, Antoine Louis Hennepin.  Hennepin, who had a passion for “pure and severe virtue” and La Salle, who had a passion for “moral weaknesses” never quite saw eye to eye.  Nonetheless, the expedition sailed (and were the first to do so) through Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron into Lake Michigan, then followed the St. Joseph River to what is today South Bend Indiana, where they constructed Fort Crevecoeur, present day Peoria, Illinois.  At this point the explorers parted ways with La Salle returning on foot to Frontenac to resupply and Hennepin continuing onward via the Illinois River to the Mississippi.   Hennepin attempted to explore southwards towards the mouth of the Mississippi but, in his own words, “the nations did not give us the time to navigate up and down this river.”  Instead he traveled northward past St. Anthony Falls and modern day Minneapolis to Lac des Issatis (Leech Lake), a source of the Mississippi.  From here Hennepin attempted a return to Fort Crevecoeur, but was instead captured by a band of wandering Sioux who took him to the Mille Lacs region of Minnesota, near Lake Superior.  Hennepin remained in Sioux custody until the adventurer Daneil Greysolon Delhut, who had negotiated a peace treaty with the Sioux, ransomed him.     Hennepin and La Salle never met again.  La Salle went on to explore the length of the Mississippi, named Louisiana, claimed it for France, and established a short lived colony near Matagorda Bay, Texas.   Hennepin, who had enough adventure, returned to France where he published an enormously popular book,  Description de la Louisiane , of which this is the first Dutch edition.  This book features a map that depicts much of the upper Mississippi valley but does not suggest exploration as far as the Gulf of Mexico – as do Hennepin’s two later maps.  This map is believed to be the first printed map made from actual observations to bear the name “Louisiana”.  In this work Hennepin claims to have coined the term “Louisiane” but, it was in fact La Salle who had first named the region.  This edition of Hennepin's map features a curious title cartouche in the lower right quadrant intended to represent the triumph of Christianity in Louisiana.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Italy-rizzizannoni-1814,Antique Map: 1814 Rizzi-Zannoni Map of Italy,Italy from the Original Map by G. A. Rizzi-Zannoni.,"One of the most attractive maps of Italy to appear in the 19th century, this is the 1814 Mawman and Smith re-engraving of G. A. Rizzi-Zannoni’s magnificent 1802  Nuova Carta dell'Italia .  Only slightly smaller than Rizzi-Zannoni’s map in the vertical dimension, Mawman has narrowed the map in the horizontal by reformatting the whole with a northwesterly orientation in which most of Sicily and Corsica are cropped out in order to draw the focus of the map more firmly to the peninsular mainland of Italy.   The result is an intensely detailed map in which Rizzi-Zannoni’s fine engraving work is preserved and in some cased improved upon by Smith’s own careful hand.     At over 40 inches in height and 17 inches in width, this map is a spectacular display piece in its own right.  The engraving throughout, the work of Smith, is magnificent with topography rendered in stunning profile.  A red and drawn line shows the classicists’ ideal tour through Italy.  Entering Italy by crossing the Alps from France, the tour leads through Torino and Vercelli before heading northeast to visit Lake Como, from which the path then leads south to Milan and Genoa.  Taking to ship at Genoa, our tourist skirts the coast of the Italian Riviera to land at Livorno before turning inland to Lucca and Florence (Firenze).  From Florence the tour leads southward through central Italy to reach Rome and, ultimately, Naples.  Returning along the same course the route once again passes through Rome but then heads eastward across the peninsula to Loretto on Italy’s Adriatic coast.  From Loretto the route passes northwards along an old Roman causeway to Parma, Lake Garda, and ultimately Padua and Venice.  The more adventurous traveller can then continue northeast to Trento and finally eastwards into Greece.  Mawman planned his this reimagining of Rizzi-Zannoni’s map at the request of the Reverend, J. C. Eustace, who planned to include it in his  Classical Tour Through Italy , an early  19th century touring guide to the antiquities of Italy.  Today  Classical Tour through Italy  rarely appears on the market, and in most cases does not contain this map, which appeared in only one edition.   Moreover, this particular example does not correspond in format to any of the known examples of  Classical Tour… , suggesting that it must have also been issued and sold independently by Mawman.  This map is extremely scarce.  We have been unable to identify any examples appearing in dealer catalogs or at auction in the last 30 years. Moreover, we have isolated only a single example in an institutional collection, that being, typically enough, in the collection of Rome's British School.",1814 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/rizzi-zannoni.txt,"Eustace, J.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/MountainsandRivers-darton-1823,Antique Map: 1823 Darton and Gardner Comparative Chart of World Mountains and Rivers,"New and Improved View of the Comparative Heights, of the Principal Mountains and Lengths of the Principal Rivers in the World.","A groundbreaking convention establishing map of extreme scarcity, this is William Darton and W. R. Gardner’s 1823 comparative mountains and rivers of the world chart.  According to Rumsey this is the first known example of a comparative chart to depict both mountains and rivers in the same plate – thus defining a cartographic style that would flourish throughout the remainder of the 19th century.     The comparative mountains section, occupying the lower right half of this chart, details the principle mountains of the world.  Ranges are color coded to show different types of vegetation and numerically reference tables in the lower right quadrant.  The elevations of a number of important cities including Paris, Rome, London, Geneva, Mexico, Bogota, and Quito, among others, are noted.    There are also extensive notations on vegetation, volcanic activity, and lichen, much of which is no doubt influenced by Humboldt.  The Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri is identified as the world's greatest mountain. Even the ballooning feat of Gay-Lussac who attained an altitude of 7000 meters in 1808 is noted.  The upper left portion of this chart is dominated by the world's greatest rivers.  Darton and Gardner attempt not only to express the lengths of the various rivers, but also details regarding their course and sources.  All along each river important lakes, cities, directions, and distance measurements are noted.  Here the Amazon is identified as the world's greatest river at some 3600 miles, followed by the Mississippi at 3530 miles.  The Nile comes up a sad fifth at just 2686 miles, though admittedly its full length had yet to be explored.  This map is extremely scarce.  It was issued and sold independently by Darton at his Map and Print Shop, 58 Holborn Hill, London.  Examples of this map were issued in both case (as in the Rumsey example) and flat (as in this example) format; however, it was never included in an atlas or compiled publication.  This is only the second known example (Rumsey’s being the first) to appear either on the market or in an institutional collection. That Wolter, whose study of Comparative charts is the most significant scholarly approach to this material currently published, was not aware of this map is suggestive of its extreme rarity.  A unique example that will not likely appear on the market again.",1823 (dated),http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/darton.txt,,http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/L/MountainsandRivers-darton-1823.jpg,MountainsandRivers-darton-1823,14.5,11.5
http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/SpanishNorthAmerica-thomson-1814,Antique Map: 1814 Thomson Map of Mexico and Texas,Spanish North America.,"This beautiful 1814 map, along with Pinkerton’s similar map, is most likely the most important large format English atlas map of the American Southwest to be produced in the 19th century. The map depicts Mexico from the Yucatan north to what would soon become the Republic of Texas, the Louisiana Territory, and what would eventually be the U.S. States of New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California, Nevada, Utah, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Colorado. This map is based largely on the maps of Alexander von Humboldt and Zebulon Pike.   The general treatment of the Rocky Mountains is drawn directly from Humboldt important map of 1811, issued just 3 years prior.  The 1806 – 1807 explorations of Zebulon Pike in modern day Colorado are also in evidence as is Pike’s Peak, here noted as the “Highest Peak”.  The name Texas appears on this map only as the name of a settlement on the Colorado River, which is here mapped twice. The Great Salt Lakes is mapped according to the limited knowledge preserved from the Escalante-Onate expedition of 1776.  Here both the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake are mapped, both with indistinct borders. The Louisiana region is especially well notated with numerous annotations regarding the Indian tribes inhabiting the region and a number of advances over Humboldt – such as the correct mapping of the Arkansas River.

http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NorthAmerica-thomson-1814,Antique Map: 1814 Thomson Map of North America,North America.,"This beautiful map is John Thomson’s important 1814 interpretation of North America.  This map covers from the Arctic Sea south to the southern tip of Florida and the northern parts of Mexico.    Cartographically Thomson draws heavily from the explorations of Samuel Herne, Alexander MacKenzie, Louis and Clark, David Thomson, and others.    This map naturally offers impressive detail both with regard to those better known parts of the United States located east of the Mississippi as well as in the British controlled provinces north of the Missouri River.  The Great Lakes as well as many of the lakes and riverways to the west of the Hudson Bay are also exceptionally well mapped giving evidence to the work of French and British explorers seeking a river passage to the Pacific as well as to the exploratory efforts of the Northwest Company and the Hudson Bay Company, most notably Herne and Mackenzie treks to the Arctic.   The Transmississippi is, by contrast, only sparsely mapped in accordance with the 1811 cartographic speculations of Alexander von Humboldt, especially his remarkable treatment of the Rocky Mountains, compounded by relatively limited information drawn from the just published journals of the Louis and Clark Expedition.   Curiously neither Great Salt Lake nor Utah Lake are anywhere in evidence despite being mapped in some of Thomson’s other maps of the region, such as his Spanish North America plate.  Another curiosity is the interesting path commencing at the confluence of the Oisconsin and Mississippi Rivers and running east nearly to the Missouri - its source and purpose are a mystery In a clear case of carto-advocacy Thomson has attached the name New Albion to the entire western coast from Vancouver Island to the Gulf of California, thereby asserting a British claim to the region dating to Drake’s 16th century circumnavigation of the world.
